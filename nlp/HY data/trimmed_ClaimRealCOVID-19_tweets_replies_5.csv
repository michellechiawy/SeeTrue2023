No.

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19."
625,100011,1235234927937048577,1235241193765842945,"Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask."

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19."

COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.

1665,100013,1244019937670094848,1244020228217917440,"These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.

By the time it's visibly bad it will be too late.

Point is we can't wait and need to try everything we can to stop the spread. Otherwise the NHS will be on its knees. Italy has more hospital beds per capita than us.

3901,100033,1235243232935792642,1235238334722699265,"How does COVID-19 spread? 

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales."

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work."

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized."
3904,100033,1235243232935792642,1235240257404227586,"Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19."
3905,100033,1235243232935792642,1235241193765842945,"Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask."

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19."
