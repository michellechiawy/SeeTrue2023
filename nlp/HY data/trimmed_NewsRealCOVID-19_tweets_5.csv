Quarantine, social distancing, masks isn't necessary if you are already infected.

15662,414,1242821936406806535,@gawendaseminars I have heard from anthem BCBS and Aetna secondary they will pick up Telehealth for Medicare patients if Medicare does not cover it...have you heard this? Is this possible? I hear them say it but...
15663,414,1241195562528952320,Hey Twitter! Did you know Medicare DOES NOT cover the cost of a Telehealth GP appointment? That's right! If you're too high risk to be seen in person you have to pay for a Skype appointment!
