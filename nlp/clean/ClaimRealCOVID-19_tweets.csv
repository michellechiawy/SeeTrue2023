Answer: Children who are in general good health can wear a non-medical or fabric mask #facemask #kidsmask #questionoftheday #cdcguideline"
REAL,"Just to be clear...WHO and UNICEF advise that children aged 12+ should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area. Can we move on, please?!"
REAL,"I donât get it. @WHO said âchildren aged 12 and over should wear a mask ... when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the areaâ - erm, why not classrooms then? 30+ kids arenât going to be 1 metre apart are they ð¤·ð¼ââï¸"

Children should be wearing a mask when they play outdoor with neighborhood kids. Theyâll get used to it. (This means your child is not wearing a mask out or not playing with neighbors. Either way is bad.)"
REAL,Why would anyone want to send children back to school sit in classes with mask on all day? If you have to wear mask all day then something tell me they should not go. The concept of school is wrong. Doctors don't even wear a mask all day. The president don't wear one at all.
REAL,"Why are parents allowing their children not to wear a mask to school?

REAL,"Here's a thought while adults are being stupid about masks, kids know that everyone should be wearing masks. What about the child forced to be in school all days with kids who are not wearing masks. Do you think that worried child, or children, is learning anything?! #WearAMask"
REAL,"Is it just me....or are conservatives taking about #SaveTheChildren just to go against liberals and Democrats? It doesnât feel genuine. Every post goes a long the lines of âWe should be focused on the children, but yeah, wear a mask ðâ Like?? Thatâs not genuine concern??"

REAL,"IDK at this point anyone who objects to wearing a mask should be treated like toddlers. Spoken to like the small tantruming children they are.

""Aww ish shomeone cwanky that they have to wear a mask?"""
REAL,"Secondly, it's not compulsory for my children to wear a mask, why should they be more at risk than me?"
REAL,"Children should not have to wear masks. Can you imagine a little kid vomiting in their mask and swallowing it back and choking on it , who gets Sued then?"
REAL,"If people don`t want to wear a mask, why should they seatbelts? WHY look both ways when crossing a road?, Teach your children it is OK to touch the hot stove. Stare at the sun. What kind of role model are we setting for the kids????????? I`m old and very ashamed of things."

People who don't take the eventual #COVID19 vaccine should not be allowed to travel internationally. (poll)"
REAL,WHO should be renamed to WORST HEALTH ORGANISATION. Why there has been no check on the worldâs virus factory China? Why the Chinese virology is not been baned yet? Total ban to be imposed no imports or travel from china @WHO @UN #BunyaVirus #coronavirus #hantavirus #chinesevirus
REAL,Itâs about time the government stopped messing with everyoneâs hopes and aspirations and just said anyone who travels should isolate for 14 days. What they are doing now causes stress and costs money. They do not know what they are doing. What is this virus really? @BorisJohnson
REAL,Why is there no converstion about kids especially teens getting tested. I know teens who teat to travel.  Its not fun but not that bad. Is there a medical reason kids should not test? If teachers asked for that I could understand it.
REAL,Does the speed limit not apply to those who ride motorbikes? I donât think Iâve ever seen them travel at the speed they should be ð¤¬

REAL,I like to watch the videos about travel cons. Rip offs. Things to bwver do. Places you should not go and the women who prey on men in other countries. Places I will never go. But the videos are so beautiful. And I be wondering can I spot the conwoman's team of male robbers?
REAL,.@DGCAIndia @HardeepSPuri whatâs the fate of the flight ticket holders whoâre still waiting for their ticket refunds from airlines &amp; agents for travel ban due to lockdowns? Focus should be on the travel date &amp; not on booking dates. @narendramodi @PMOIndia @airindiain @makemytrip

REAL,"Seeing influencers are back to travel and socializing in Kenya. Is it wise? While travel restrictions were lifted, not sure non-essential travel should be encouraged. With the covid situation in Kenya, those who can afford to should probably be isolating more right now not less."
REAL,"Letâs see, we have the state medical assn composed of doctors of every specialty asking for a statewide mask mandate and a Governor who has no medical training saying no. Who knows better what we should do? People will travel from counties with a mandate to those that do not."
REAL,Private &amp; Charter schools get to pick and choose who they take. Thatâs the only real choice in this. When a student canât hang he or she gets sent to the local public school. Zip code should not determine anything. Why does a student need to travel across town? #LifeLibertyLevin
REAL,"The WHO is not alerting the world reg the covid 19 as fast as it should be.  Now, it is saying that the covid 19 can also travel through air and we need to be careful.  How about if covid 19 travels through 'water'.  When are they going to declare it - after some more die?"
