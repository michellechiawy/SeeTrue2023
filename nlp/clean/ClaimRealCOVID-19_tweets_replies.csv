REAL,@eoinmauricedaly @Clarabkelly also in general I guess their coughs/sneezes/breathing is below the level of other people's faces so less likely to go on them
REAL,@Clarabkelly Everyone should wear a mask. Children in other countries do.

REAL,"5/ About 15 people at that party were exposed to Steve. 10 developed symptoms on 6/9, brought it home and infected another 30 people by the time Steve went to the hospital on 6/12."
REAL,6/ So you see ...having access to testing with timely results can make a difference when theres widespread transmission bc people will stay home for a day..but to stay home for 10 days while not knowing your results? Good luck. Need more resources to help our health departments.
REAL,7/Contact tracing is effectiveif only having to trace for 2 days &amp; not 10 days. Testing is effectiveif people have access and can get results quickly enough.
REAL,"8/ masks = seatbelts &amp; airbags. 
Social distancing= healthy distance from car in front of you. 
Hand hygiene= make sure your brakes work and fluids are full. 
Testing &amp; CT= when an accident has occurred, how to mitigate damage to your self, others. Defensive driving."

REAL,3/ Example B: Steve exposed June 1st. Symptoms 6/5. Thinks its allergies. Waits a day or two. Has a fever on 6/7. Someone says get tested. Trying to get access to testing. Everywhere full. No insurance. Gets prescriptions from Walgreens. Groceries for his mom on 6/10. (Contd).
REAL,4/ Steve cant breathe. Goes to the ED on 6/12. Tests positive. Where were you 6/3-6/5? . Steve is in ICU. The graduation party from 6/4 was awesome. A few people got sick afterwards but went back to their home states. Someone heard about Steve.

REAL,"In case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious48to72hours before they start to experience symptoms. Contacts are then notified of their potential exposure and told to be vigilant for symptoms. Contacts are recommended to get tested or self-isolate for a given amount of time."
REAL,"Why is contact tracing important?
Because it helps slow the spread of an infectious disease, like #covid19, by preventing further transmission through quickly identifying+informing people who may be infected and contagious,and then asking them to take steps to not infect others."
