The article reports a single-center (Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden), consecutive hospitalized adults neuroimaging experience, with 47/43 (exams/pts) MRI and 222/174 CT for evaluation. 75% male, 25% mortality, 62% on ventilator (19 days mean duration) "

Intra-axial susceptibilities were most common (74%), often with a non-spherical shape and predilection for white matter tract, suggestive of microvascular pathology (endotheliopathy, microthrombosis, and microinfarction) "

Leukoencephalopathy was the second most common (44%), and may have a dynamic nature. Although nonspecific, these signals may hint at neuro-inflammatory complications of COVID-19 "

Macrovascular pathology was also seen. 15 (8.6%) patients had acute ischemic infarcts, 11 (6.3%) with non-traumatic hemorrhage, 1 hemorrhagic infarct, and 6 patients with thin circumferential vessel wall enhancement "

Cranial nerve involvement included  T2 of the olfactory bulb/tract (19%), optic nerve prominent subarachnoid space (56%), bilateral facial nerve enhancement (n=1) and unilateral vestibular nerve enhancement (n=1). Cauda equina nerve roots enhancement was seen in 2 cases "

In summary, neuroimaging of COVID-19 patients show vascular and inflammatory changes. Microvascular and white matter pathology are common. Radiologists should also be vigilant for cranial nerve and spinal nerve root involvement."
