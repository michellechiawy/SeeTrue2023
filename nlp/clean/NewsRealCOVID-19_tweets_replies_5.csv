REAL,"Figures from China suggest 80% of cases are asymptomatic: 

Similarly a WHO report found 80% of cases are mild/asymptomatic: "
REAL,"Data from the diamond princess, one of the first cruise ships to have a widespread outbreak, shows 12 deaths of 712 cases (1.7% mortality). It's well known that cruise ships are especially popular with older age groups, so this mortality rate should theoretically be inflated."
REAL,"The current UK death count is at 12.6 thousand. At a mortality rate of 1.7%, there would be 763,502 total cases. However this doesn't account for the delay between contraction of the virus and death, which can be weeks."
REAL,"The government's scientific advisors have actually suggested that the mortality rate is between 0.5% and 1% ( That would put total UK cases (not accounting for delay) at between 2,573,000 and 1,286,800."

REAL,@BrendanEich @GregWildSmith @dpinsen There's going to be a significant lag between 'symptoms' and a positive test result for a number of reasons.
REAL,"As the thread notes, China says 2/3 of asymptomatic cases develop symptoms and get reclassified as confirmed cases. But Hubei has reported 303 new such cases but just 2 such patients developing symptoms and become confirmed COVID-19 patients. "
REAL,China started reporting asymptomatic cases on a daily basis since April 1. The fact that there have only been 2 patients so far this month developing symptoms while a total of 303 asymptomatic cases are reported and 852 such patients are released is odd.
REAL,It's not a like for like and it's not clear when those who ended up developed symptoms were first reported as asymptomatic cases. But the very crude calculation for purely illustrative purposes of 57/657 nationally is 8.7% and 2/303 is 0.6%.
REAL,"The fact that there are so few asymptomatic patients reported to have developed symptoms in Hubei and mainland China, in comparison to how many new asymptomatic cases have been reported so far, raises some questions."
REAL,Neither the NHC nor Hubei has provided cumulative statistics on asymptomatic cases found to date or the number of such patients later developing symptoms. So there is a limit to what we can discern from public disclosures.
REAL,"Data published on April 1 by Hubei, for example, the province reported 47 new asymptomatic cases, 1 asymptomatic patient who developed symptoms and 289 asymptomatic patients who were released from medical observation. 982 asymptomatic cases were being monitored at the time."
REAL,"That probably means there were 1,225 under medical observation in Hubei as of March 30. 

From March 31 and April 8, Hubei released 852 asymptomatic patients from observation. Noting again that there were only 2 cases of asymptomatic patients developing symptoms in this window"
REAL,"I am just using official data and have no knowledge of what's happening on the ground. Straightforward reasons could be:

-Patients are being pumped with enough drugs/treatment to keep symptoms from emerging
-It's just taking time for the symptoms to emerge

REAL,"-Incubation period may be longer than 14 days that we generally expect (there have been some cases of this)
-Patients are not being tested correctly or test kits are still not very accurate

REAL,From a fellow Immunology colleague to help understand testing...
REAL,I have borrowed this from a testing kit company website as I thought it is a good explanation of the current testing processes for COVID-19:
REAL,"Laboratory methods for diagnosing COVID-19 follow two pathways - the detection of the coronavirus itself, and the detection of the body's adaptive immune response to the virus.
The stage of COVID-19 disease progression determines which detection method is most effective."
REAL,This antibody rapid test complements nucleic acid methods such as RT-PCR to improve speed of diagnosis and monitor disease progression.
REAL,"As the disease primarily attacks the lungs, specimens taken from the upper respiratory tract may be poor in quality and could lead to false-negatives with PCR."
REAL,"To understand the clinical significance of results obtained from the antibody rapid test, the following information must be considered:"
REAL,"So here's the bit I don't understand.

#COVID19Children #COVID19Nigeria"
REAL,@ClimateWed A3 Done. #COVID19Children #COVID19Nigeria
REAL,Some children with Covid-19 can still experience serious lung disease.
REAL,Kids with simultaneous respiratory infections can be more vulnerable to Covid-19. Infants without mature immune systems can get sick from the virus.
REAL,That means epidemic control measures  from proper hand-washing to social distancing  are just as important for the young and healthy as they are for people who are older or sicker.
REAL,"Countries that have experienced more extensive outbreaks of Covid-19, including China and Italy, have seen the worst impacts of Covid-19 on older adults, with the number of people hospitalized and killed by the disease rising with age."
REAL,"Underlying health problems like high blood pressure, a depressed immune system, and diabetes have also worsened the outcomes among the infected."
REAL,"However, a small percentage of younger people, from babies to young adults, have also suffered serious harm."
REAL,"A study published in February in the Journal of the American Medical Association of more than 72,000 infected people in China showed that just 2 percent of the infected in the sample were under the age of 19."
REAL,"Similarly, a February report from the WHOs mission to China showed that only 2.4 percent of the infected were 18 years old or younger. Out of those infected young people, 2.5 percent developed severe disease and 0.2 percent developed critical disease."
REAL,"But the WHO report also noted that it is not possible to determine the extent of infection among children, what role children play in transmission, whether children are less susceptible or if they present differently clinically (i.e. generally milder presentations)."
REAL,"Which is to say few children are being tested for the virus, so there still isnt much good information about how many children are getting infected overall. And from there, its hard to gauge the rate of severe illness for the young."
REAL,"Another element is that Covid-19 seems to play out differently in children compared to what health officials have seen with other infections, such as influenza."
REAL,"Influenza, also caused by a virus that infects the airways, can be a very serious illness in children."
REAL,"Complications from influenza, like a subsequent bacterial pneumonia infection, can be fatal."
REAL,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since September, 144 children have died in the US from influenza in the current season as of March 7."
REAL,"Meanwhile, there have been no reported deaths from Covid-19 among children in the US so far."
REAL,"Everything we know about other viral infections would suggest that children are at higher risk of infection, said Bria Coates, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University and an attending physician at the Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Childrens Hospital of Chicago."
REAL,They dont tend to wash their hands very well. They dont give each other space. Which makes the lower prevalence of severe illness for Covid-19 among children all the more remarkable.
REAL,"The evidence so far suggests that although they are more at risk of contracting the disease, when they do their symptoms, if they have any at all, are milder."
REAL,Which is exactly why the schools in Australia should be closed.
REAL,More tomorrow.
REAL,Trump wants to reopen US businesses in weeks 'not months' even as deaths rise.
REAL,"At tonights White House briefing on coronavirus, Trump officials kept reminding Americans that the presidents plan to stop the spread of coronavirus was only a 15 day challenge and they were already halfway through."

REAL,"I may talk about that tomorrow,"
REAL,"Scott Morrisons office called the ABCs news boss, Gaven Morris, last week suggesting Swan should speak to Murphy.

REAL,"Test a lot, isolate, find all contacts if you can and isolate them, Swan, who trained as a medical practitioner, said on social media early last week. Stop mass mingling. Bring the public with you."
REAL,Young people as well as the elderly will die unnecessarily if we dont act. Todays cases are the result of what we didnt do two weeks ago.
REAL,Swan is right the government is wrong.
REAL,The governments handling of this crisis has been more about politics and less about good medical practice.
REAL,"I think its almost a math problem in some ways, right? says Benjamin Singer, an assistant professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine."
REAL,"Even with a lower likelihood of younger people getting critically ill, a certain percentage will get critically ill, and since the denominator is growing and growing these cases are popping up more and more."
REAL,Underlying health conditions can also make younger people susceptible to a severe case of the virus.
REAL,"In China smoking seemed prominent in this respect, but the presence of chronic disease also makes young people more vulnerable in the young as in the old."
REAL,"Where you find severe cases or even death in young people, we dont really have full information on these patients, says Lee Riley, chair of the division of infectious disease and vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley."
REAL,Its possible that some of those people might have had medical conditions that we just didnt know about.
REAL,"Even younger people who feel perfectly healthy need to take the pandemic seriously because they can spread the virus even if theyre not feeling any symptoms, Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said."
REAL,"Dont get the attitude, Well, Im young, Im invulnerable,"
REAL,"Fauci said at a press briefing  You dont want to put your loved ones at risk, particularly the ones who are elderly and the ones who have compromised conditions. We cant do this without the young people cooperating. Please cooperate with us."
REAL,"Kids can spread the virus to more vulnerable adults, and infants may have a higher risk of serious illness than older children."
REAL,This age disparity of severe cases has become a critical question as scientists race to slow the viruss spread.
REAL,"Some clues to this mystery are starting to emerge, and the answers could help establish what kinds of infection control measures are actually effective, as well as point the way toward treatments."

REAL,"This includes early self-isolation &amp; quarantine, seeking remote medical advice and not attending large gatherings or going to crowded places. The virus seems to largely affect older people and those w existing medical conditions, targeted social distancing may be most effective"
REAL,"The researchers warn, however, that large-scale measures may only be of limited effect without individual responsibility."
REAL,"Flattening the curve can avoid overwhelming health services, keep the impact on the economy to within manageable levels and effectively buy more time to develop and manufacture effective vaccines, treatments and anti-viral drug therapies. "
REAL,"Early data from China suggests that the R0 for COVID-19 could be as high as 2.5, implying that in an uncontained outbreak, 60 per cent of the population could be infected."
REAL,Professor Hans Heesterbeek .. said: Social distancing measures are societally and economically disruptive and a balance has to be sought in how long they can be held in place. The models show that stopping measures after a few months could lead to a new peak later in the year.

WHO says a total of 89 Covid-19 vaccines are in development globally.

She said; "
REAL,"launched by the WHO and partners.

More than 100 countries have joined the solidarity trial and to date, over 1, 200 patients have been randomized from the first five countries to evaluate the safety and efficacy of full drug and drug combinations."

We do have the solidarity trial which is an international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for Covid-19,"
REAL,"@vanguardngrnews Watz Nigeria doing?
Waiting to BUY"
REAL,Remdesivir has emerged as leading candidate in the short term treatment of covid-19. It works by inhibiting RNA replicase to stop covid from replicating the virus. Gilead currently uses for HIV - govt going to take steps to facilitate large-scale manufacturing by other companies
REAL,They're testing higher doses than previously used - they think dosage of 200mg followed by 100mg for 5 - 10 days is not enough. However side effects from higher dosage are a concern. Goal is an inhaled form of remdesivir so treatment can be administered remotely and more widely.
REAL,remdesivir is unlikely to be more effective for treating COVID-19 than the best monoclonal antibodies currently under development. But they won't be available for a few more months at the earliest. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Vir Biotechnology are currently leading this space.
REAL,"This approach has the potential to be in human clinical trials by June, and if expedited with assistance from the government, to be approved by this summer or fall.  But there must be regulatory flexibility and focused efforts to eliminate all avoidable bottlenecks."
REAL,Trials usually begin with a safety trial in a small number of people. Suggestion for monoclonal antibody treatments be allowed to proceed directly to a larger trial. A review of an NDA normally takes 9-12 months recommendation is to complete the review within 1 week of receipt!
REAL,broad administration can begin both as a treatment (prioritizing critically ill patients) and as a short-term vaccine immediately upon FDA approval. Desired timeframe: August-September 2020. but we'll need a vaccine-based approach to establish long-term victory over the virus.
REAL,"average time for new vaccine development and approval is six - eight years. Approaches being pursued - inactivated virus particles (Sinovac), recombinant proteins (Sanofi), live hybrid viruses (Janssen), and RNA-based vaccines (Moderna, CureVac, BioNTech/Pfizer, Translate/Sanofi)"
REAL,"At present, the non-company funding sources for the majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efforts include the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the U.S. government (BARDA), the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)"
REAL,"Modernas RNA-based vaccine has already commenced clinical trials, and whether subjects create protective antibodies will be assessed in the next few months. However, Moderna does not anticipate widespread implementation for at least 12 months."
REAL,"From a paper titled ""Scientists to Stop COVID-19"". It was released by a group of citizen-scientists with the intention of producing safe/effective COVID-19 therapeutics/vaccines in the shortest possible timeframe, and reopen society in a way that reduces risk of future outbreaks."

REAL,"Safe Homes: We demand that all rent and mortgage payments be suspended, not merely put on hold, all unhoused San Franciscans must be offered housing in vacant hotel rooms, &amp; city resources must be devoted to helping people experiencing domestic violence during shelter-in-place."
REAL,"Safe Work: We demand that essential workers be given hazard pay, and CA enforce AB5, ensuring that gig economy workers are treated and protected like other employees. We demand that Muni be operated safely for riders &amp; drivers alike by making backdoor boarding standard &amp; free."
REAL,"Safe Community: We demand a moratorium on all ICE raids and deportation proceedings, and demand the release of all detainees in ICE custody and the closure of immigrant detention centers."
REAL,"(Safe Community continued):

We also demand alternatives to police enforcement during the shelter in place and the closure of 850 Bryant, as well as a drastic reduction of Californias prison population, and an end to prison labor."
REAL,Safe World: We demand an end to US sanctions on all foreign nations and denounce the belligerent saber-rattling campaign against Venezuela.

REAL,"Side note: if @smc90 doesn't start making some ""Most innovative people in business lists,"" the editors really need to take a moment to reflect on their selection criteria. She's stood up the tech equivalent of Vox with many fewer resources, and much more journalistic integrity!"
REAL,"Back to the main point  A new interest in bio, the lack of a clear, investable tech platform shift, and the fact that many VCs find comfort in having a ""thesis,"" and you could see the ""bio century"" being the new rallying cry. 

At least for a while...

"
REAL,"Of course, this is easier said than done. Healthcare presents unique and illogical conundrums. 

The regulation and payment paths are a mess. 

And there may be a desire among new entrants to fund moonshots, rather than the next Veeva/Medidata.

REAL,"Even if this prediction pans out, it may not result in great returns. The mid-2000s move to ""cleantech"" became a cautionary tale for VCs.

"
REAL,"The worldwide trial is ongoing, w/preliminary results not expected until next month.

Drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound, University of Chicago Medicine said

Still, clues continue to accumulate

#Gilead
 "
REAL,"#Remdesivir, a clear liquid that is injected into a standard IV, is already used to treat other viruses such as ebola and herpes

Patients who are part of the trial are on either a five or ten-day course, with a larger loading dose of Remdesivir

"
REAL,"with a larger loading dose of #Remdesivir given on the first day and smaller doses each following day

The trial at St. Joseph Hospital began April 9 and is being overseen by #Gilead Sciences, the Bay Area biotech company that makes Remdesivir.

 "
REAL,"Two Chinese studies would have provided the earliest clinical evidence of whether #Gilead Sciences #remdesivir works in #COVID19. But now both studies have stopped due to a lack of eligible patients as the outbreak has been controlled in the country.
"
REAL,"One clear positive is the lack of safety red flagsarguably to be expected based on how #remdesivir performed in a larger study of Ebola patients

availability of viral load data would instill more confidence improvements seen in the study were linked
"

Evidence from this study and previous research in animals &amp;

"
REAL,"cell cultures showed #remdesivir can be classified as a ""direct-acting #antiviral"" against the new #coronavirus

""We obtained almost identical results as we reported previously w/MERS, so we see remdesivir is a very potent inhibitor for coronavirus

 "
REAL,"#Gilead Sciences Races to Manufacture #Remdesivir, but Chemistry Has Speed Limits

Gilead Sciences must secure supply chains, ramp-up manufacturing capacity, &amp; distribute the drug throughout the world. That might prove more difficult than investors realize

The company also said another trial by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases met its main goal. It did not provide further details, however.

REAL,"3) Data that shook the world - Modelling the COVID-19 pandemic and the Impact of NPIs to reduce COVID-19 mortality &amp; healthcare demand. 

This section summarises how infectious disease models work, &amp; how they are used to predict &amp; develop effective strategies to combat diseases."
REAL,"Most epidemic models are based on SIR (susceptible, infected, and dead/removed) models. The primary inputs of these models are the SIR numbers, R (the reproduction number of the virus eg., how many people one person infects on average), and the incubation period of the disease."
REAL,"Other important inputs are the mortality rate, hospitalisation rate, healthcare capacity, population demographics, methods of disease transmission, &amp; implementation of NPIs. I will now refer to some of the main models which have impacted UK (&amp; global) policy in response to COVID."
REAL,"First, I think it is important to give some context. As COVID-19 is a novel disease with, at the time, little known about it, early modelling was very difficult to get accurate. Most models were based off a 2006 model from the paper 'Strategies for pandemic influenza mitigation."
REAL,"For context, the 2006 influenza pandemic paper has several interesting findings, predicting case isolation/household quarantine would have the most significant impact, school closures could reduce peak attack rates by 40%, and travel bans would have little overall effect.
14/ "
REAL,"When @neilferguson published the model on the predicted deaths from COVID-19 and the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 mortality, it was an urgent call to switch strategies from mitigation to suppression, countering his own earlier paper on strategies during an influenza pandemic.
15/"
REAL,"Soon after, both the UK and the US government (and more) effectively changed strategy from mitigation to one of suppression, initiating 'lockdown.' This makes the @imperialcollege paper one of the most influential of all time, &amp; so is worth taking the time to read and understand."
REAL,"The model predicted that if countries continued with mitigation, there would be over 500,000 deaths in the UK from COVID-19, millions hospitalised, and a peak healthcare demand at 8 - 30 times surge capacity. 
17/

 "
REAL,"To reduce mortality &amp; stress on healthcare systems, whilst also minimising the total period of lockdown, the model recommends cycling periods of mitigation &amp; suppression (for up to 18 months!), controlled by regionalised capacity 'trigger points.
18/ "
REAL,"Even with these NPIs in place, COVID-19 deaths still approach 50,000, and the healthcare system will be extremely stressed over a protracted period &amp; likely take years to recover, but will not be overwhelmed. Authors acknowledge the long-term feasibility of some of these measures "
REAL,"With some criticism that the model is not peer-reviewed &amp; too bleak in its outlook, some revisions have been made to reflect a higher(!) R number, increased healthcare capacity &amp; to reflect the NPIs that the UK has taken, although this hasn't affected the main conclusions by much"
REAL,"A @cmmid_lshtm model also agreed with the switch from mitigation to suppression, concluding mitigation wouldn't have reduced R sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding NHS availability &amp; that more extreme restrictions were necessary to keep ICU demand below capacity.
21/ "
REAL,"This @nature article gives a good summary of the simulations driving the worlds response to COVID-19 &amp; how social mixing is measured, whilst the 2nd link is to an Imperial report estimating the impact NPIs have had across Europe. 

"
REAL,"As the situation develops, and things such as more accurate data, antiviral drugs, and increased healthcare and contact tracing capacities come into play, these models will be updated, and the strategy may then be able to return to one of mitigation until a vaccine arrives."
REAL,"It is also worth noting that that @neil_ferguson of @imperialcollege will be releasing their model on strategies to lift the lockdown in the next few days. But, models are only simulations of the real world, and have many limitations..."
REAL,"This @bmj paper nicely highlights how whilst models are crucially useful tools in a pandemic, over-reliance on modelling can lead to missteps and blind spots in our response, as they are based around assumptions and therefore have many limitations. "
REAL,"And finally, a link to a perspective on how modelling can only influence politicians, not force their hand,  who have the ultimate control over decisions. However exasperated many of us are by any the response to COVID-19, such decisions are ultimately political..."

"
REAL,"They predict that weekly screening of HCWs and other at-risk groups using PCR or point-of-care tests for infection irrespective of symptoms is estimated to reduce their contribution to transmission by 25-33%, on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms. "

2. You'll find video meetings over Zoom/Skype are less prone to late starting, over-running and getting sidetracked than face-to-face. 

3. Pets are great company."
REAL,"4. Short breaks after 90 mins of work will keep you productive.

5. The real issue isn't getting motivated to start, it's being disciplined enough to stop. Only work in one room and at a designated time, stop, close the door and do other stuff."
REAL,"6. At least once a day, phone someone for a chat. You know, like in olden times.

7. When the tea and coffee runs out, things turn nasty. Online supermarket deliveries rule.

8. Try and eat something different each day for lunch and don't have it in the room you work in."
REAL,"I'm lucky - I've not felt the isolation some experience working from home but it's not for everyone. If you do feel lonely, reach out. You'll be amazed how welcoming strangers can be on social media. And seek professional help if you're really struggling.

REAL,"*What is the origin of COVID-19?
According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of a seafood market might explain its outbreak, thus representing a clear example as to why food control is important. This conclusion is by no means restricted to China [1]."
REAL,"*How is COVID-19 transmitted?
Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. Furthermore, there is no evidence that an infected mom might transmit it to her child [2]."
REAL,"*What are its symptoms?
The most common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 illness are fever, cough, and fatigue, while other symptoms include sputum production, headache, shortness of breath, diarrhea, blood expectoration, and reduced level of lymphocytes [2]."
REAL,"*How fast does COVID-19 affect its victims?
The symptoms of infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 5.2 days. The period from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days (median of 14 days) [2]."
REAL,"*Which population is the most vulnerable?
This period of incubation is dependent on the age of the patient and the status of the patient's immune system. It is shorter among patients &gt;70-years old compared with those under that age [2]."
REAL,"*Is there any treatment available yet?
There are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 yet, and it is unlikely to find a treatment for at least another 1218 months, even though huge funding has been committed and there are four candidates in development [3]."
REAL,"*Is there a way to prevent its spread?
Various bodies including the WHO and US CDC have issued advice on preventing further spread of COVID-19. They recommend avoiding travel to high-risk areas, and the consumption of meat from regions with known COVID-19 outbreak [4]."
REAL,"Basic hand hygiene measures are also recommended, including frequent hand washing and the use of face masks. Japanese-based company Bespoke Inc has also launched an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot (Bebot) that provides up to date information regarding the coronavirus [4]."
REAL,"*Are children immune to Covid-19?
Experts suggest that children are most likely asymptomatic (not immune), thus producing a reduced incidence rate in this population as they have not been extensively tested yet [5]."
REAL,"**Do pets represent a source of infection?
There is no evidence that pets can spread COVID-19 or that they might be a source of infection. However, because all animals can carry germs, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals [6]."

The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. #BreakingTheChain,@YaliBauchi @NCDCgov"
REAL,"Virology
Corona is a latin word meaning crown
Spherical or pleomorphic enveloped particles containing single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. The envelope bears club-shaped glycoprotein projections."
REAL,"Classification
Coronaviruses (and toroviruses) are classified together on the basis of the crown or halo-like appearance of the envelope glycoproteins, and on characteristic features of chemistry and replication. #BreakingTheChain, @YaliBauchi @NCDCgov @SenBalaMohammed"
REAL,"Most human coronaviruses fall into one of two serotypes: OC43-like and 229E-like. #BreakingTheChain, @NCDCgov @SenBalaMohammed @YaliBauchi"

Cases of COVID-19 were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 31st December, 2019.

Zoonotic
Human to Human
Respiratory Viruses are viruses hat infect and replicate in the airways.

Contact (e.g with object that have been infected with droplets and then touching eyes, nose and/or mouth)
#BreakingTheChain, @NCDCgov @YaliBauchi @SenBalaMohammed"
REAL,"Pathophysiology
Pathogenesis
Transmission is usually via airborne droplets to the nasal mucosa. Virus replicates locally in cells of the ciliated epithelium, causing cell damage and inflammation. @NCDCgov @SenBalaMohammed @YaliBauchi #BreakingTheChain"
REAL,"Studies in both organ cultures and human volunteers show that coronaviruses are extremely fastidious and grow only in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells. Infected cells become vacuolated, show damaged cilia, and may form syncytia. #BreakingTheChain, @NCDCgov ,@YaliBauchi"
REAL,"Cell damage triggers the production of inflammatory mediators, which increase nasal secretion and cause local inflammation, swelling. These responses in turn stimulate sneezing, obstruct the airway, and raise the temperature of the mucosa.#BreakingTheChain,  @YaliBauchi @NCDCgov"
REAL,"Diagnosis
The most useful method for laboratory diagnosis is to collect paired sera (from the acute and convalescent phases of the disease) and to test by ELISA for a rise in antibodies against OC43 and 229E. #BreakingTheChain, @YaliBauchi, @ncdc"

REAL,"NPIs only used when there is a great risk of people dying.  NOTE school closures only work when you pull the trigger early.  NPIs do not work well if not well-implemented, or too late or too short of a time. "
REAL,"Be Clear: Practice Social Distancing can be vague.  What it really means is ""stay 6 feet away, stay at home, get groceries once per week."""
REAL,"The US is a unified info ecosystem acting in a chaotic fashion right now.  Each new social distancing order within the US adds confusion, anxiety, lessens effectiveness. when we do this with less intention, human rights violations may happen."
REAL,Restrictions without support makes the disease less visible to the privileged and pus more disease to the most marginalized.
REAL,IMPORTANT: Imagine a new story: based on solidarity and not fear - clear and early triggers that are unified with simple language and planned equitable support. And use the time while we are cycling through NPIs/social distancing to ramp up testing and tracing cases.

REAL,I'm not scared of dying. I'm scared of being alive and never knowing how many people around me will lose loved ones because we're too afraid to stand up to retail companies and employers who would rather risk our health than make any meaningful changes or sacrifices.
REAL,This is what I mean when I say stay home. If you come into a public place because you are bored of being at home look me in the eyes and tell me how glad you are that we're open. How glad you are to exponentially up my odds of burying a loved one before summer is out. Get out.

REAL,"4. For an accessible and good overview of some of the problems with CFR estimation during an ongoing outbreak and ways to mitigate them, see this article published during the Ebola outbreak. 

 "
REAL,"5. Technically sCFR just specifies what counts as a 'case' by way of definition: infected+symptomatic. But since sCFR is often used in estimation studies in ID epi lit, but not in wider non-technical reporting, it's a useful shorthand for estimates generated using these methods "
REAL,"8. Mid-outbreak IFR is even more difficult to estimate (w/o decent serosurvey data). There are efforts to estimate IFR, but there's a gulf in the range of estimates (in contrast to sCFR). pop infection % (&amp; hence IFR) is one of the impt issues we are more in the dark abt. "
REAL,"9. We will have a much better understanding of COVID's IFR when population serological studies that test for prior infection by detecting antibodies, start rolling in. A lot of progress on serological dev recently, but will have to wait for surveys to be conducted/released. "
REAL,10. My point isn't to quibble over which estimates or range of estimates for the various mortality risk measures are most sound given current but limited data (which is typically the case mid-outbreak) 
REAL,11. My point rather is that conflating diff types of mortality risk estimates w/o any attn to case definitions &amp; methods leads to bad &amp; sometimes wildly deceptive analysis: e.g. a common sleight of hand compares seasonal flu sCFR to COVID IFR under generic cover of mortality rate 
REAL,"12. Thread on *exactly* the example I mentioned above. It really is such a common downplaying move (Fauci et. al pull same stunt in NEJM):

"
REAL,"See how Fauci et al play fast &amp; loose with fatality risk estimates to push their desired conclusion. Starts w/ a reported 1.4% CFR in a Chinese cohort, adds an assumption about symp:asymp ratio (thereby shifting to *IFR*) and compares that vague 'considerably&lt;1%' IFR to flu CFR! "
REAL,"What's remarkable is Fauci presents two CFR figures: 1.4% in the Chinese sample &amp; 0.1% for seasonal flu (so 14x greater for COVID-19), yet through some manipulative fatality risk case shifting (&amp; heavy dose of assumptions) he concludes they're similar...

"
REAL,"More of the same, this time from CNN. Compares Verity et al's estimated COVID-19 infection fatality risk to seasonal flu's symptomatic case fatality risk (its IFR is oc *much* lower). 

 "
REAL,"Not mentioned in the CNN article that the Imperial College team's projection of 2.2 mil deaths in the US if left unmitigated uses the same IFR estimates in the Lancet paper (which they also authored).

The stubborn level of new cases at ~25,000 a day or more is not from better testing.

REAL,"A bit of a back story on the science of face masks/respirators video - I was asked by @dsky about creating a simple primer on the science of respirators and face masks, and was shocked to find that this doesnt already exist ... (1/n) "
REAL,"... this is an area of R&amp;D I've been involved with for decades, and I'm well aware that how respirators etc. work isn't intuitive, and that simply because something looks like a face mask, doesn't mean it'll work like on! ...(3/n)"
REAL,"... to fill this gap the video is a really basic primer on the science of how respirators and face masks capture particles, what causes them to fail, and how to design them well. Here's the link again:  (4/n)"

REAL,"Por qu tienes que ponerte mascarilla quirrgica, de tela o lo que puedas tener a mano aunque te veas sano?
Abro hilo "
REAL,"Ya que en Espaa solo se recomienda y no se obliga a usar mascarillas a TODA la poblacin SANA, he encontrado un estudio que os voy a exponer lo mejor que pueda.
"
REAL,En la Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) han realizado un estudio sobre el efecto del uso de mascarillas en TODA la comunidad para controlar la enfermedad por COVID-19.
REAL,"En HKSAR, viven 7.45 millones de personas, siendo la tercera rea ms densamente poblada del mundo con 6.700 personas/metro cuadrado."
REAL,"Ellos haban sufrido el SARS en 2003 y la gripe pandmica H1N1 en 2009, por lo tanto conocan las medidas de cierre de fronteras, cuarentena, test, rastreo de contactos y lavado de manos frecuente."
REAL,"Adems de medidas de distanciamiento social, como el cierre de escuelas, trabajo en casa y cese de actividad econmica."
REAL,"Debido a esta experiencia, tras el anuncio oficial de un grupo de pacientes con neumona en Wuhan el 31 de diciembre de 2020 y la identificacin del SARS-CoV-2 el 12 de febrero de 2020, la poblacin estaba en alerta mxima."
REAL,"Aunque inicialmente el gobierno de HKSAR solo hizo la recomendacin de uso de mascarilla quirrgica a personas con sntomas respiratorios, la poblacin US MASCARILLAS VOLUNTARIAMENTE  desde la fase previa a la pandemia de COVID-19."
REAL,"Pero hay un detalle importante, no se haba investigado la eficacia de usar o no mascarilla en TODA la poblacin durante las epidemias pasadas y la actual COVID-19."
REAL,"Existe una diferencia notable entre el SARS 2003 que presenta fiebre alta y neumona progresiva, y COVID-19 que se asocia con sntomas muy leves."
REAL,"Entonces, los TRANSMISORES ASINTOMTICOS representan un papel muy importante para FRENAR al virus. "
REAL,Para evaluar y controlar la propagacin del COVID-19 en HKSAR hicieron este estudio.
REAL,67 trabajadores (9 Unidad de Control de Infecciones y 58 del Departamento de Microbiologa) residentes en 18 distritos de HKSAR se dedicaron a contar quin llevaba mascarilla y quin no entre las primeras 50 personas que se encontrarn en su trayecto hacia al hospital Queen Mary.
REAL,"Durante tres das consecutivos, del 6 al 8 de abril de 2020, se observaron a 10.050 personas y solo 337 no llevaban mascarilla."
REAL,"El 97% de la poblacin LLEVABA MASCARILLA de forma VOLUNTARIA, ignorando las recomendaciones de la OMS de usar mascarilla solo las personas con sntomas respiratorios."
REAL,"En HKSAR, hasta el da 100 de la epidemia se diagnosticaron 961 pacientes. La incidencia de COVID-19 en HKSAR (129.0 por milln de habitantes) fue significativamente menor que la de Espaa (2983.2), Italia (2250.8) o Alemania (1241.5)."
REAL,"En el estudio se comparan los casos positivos en entornos recreativos donde las personas no usaban mascarilla (ir a un restaurante, ir a un karaoke) y casos positivos en entornos de trabajo donde si se llevaba puesta la mascarilla."
REAL,"Como conclusin y ante los hallazgos de que puede haber muchas personas ASINTOMTICAS, el uso de mascarillas en TODA la poblacin puede contribuir al control de COVID-19."
REAL,"Este hilo esta dedicado a @YanLsp  que me ha ayudado en correcciones y a @PabloFuente  por inspirar, informar y ayudar a tanta gente."

REAL,"Quote, part 1: ""At this point you might be asking: Why are all these research teams announcing such optimistic forecasts when so many experts are skeptical about even an 18-month timeline? Perhaps because its not just the public listening  its investors, too."""
REAL,"... who are Anthony Fauci's ""shareholders""? Yes, his 12- to 18-month timeline has met with some educated skepticism. But I don't think you can attribute his optimism to ""shareholders.""

So the notion that Big Pharma is just pumping its stock here doesn't hold water.

"
REAL,"Why does this matter? Lab directors are trying to increase testing during a pandemic and had to get creative. Some increased OT, staffed weekends and hired extra workers. But others had larger staffing issues."
REAL,"In Alaska, lab director Bernard Jilly says he hired back retired workers, sought out college faculty and students, and even delayed his own retirement (in March!)."

REAL,"They don't have the years of training that it takes to work in an environment where we're constantly working with highly infectious organisms here in this lab,"" Ferguson said."
REAL,Jilly and Ferguson are just a few of the public health lab directors who have been forced to make tough budget decisions. Here's a look at the national impact: 
REAL,There are several reasons for the budget troubles. States - which have to balance their budgets - had to make tough decisions after the Great Recession.
REAL,Federal funding also fluctuated over time. The feds rush out billions during an infectious disease outbreak only to scale back when the worries wane. This chart showing annual funding from a public health grant is a good example of the funding yo-yo. 
REAL,The @APHL - which represents public health labs - says the boom and bust funding makes it hard for lab directors to manage a budget and retain staff.
REAL,"Why does this matter? Well, the cuts and inconsistent federal funding happened despite repeated warnings from the @USGAO that lab capacity was maxed out. "
REAL,"Even states that increased funding for labs are struggling with the testing demand. In Minnesota, @GovTimWalz said a few weeks ago he wants to see tests hit 5,000/day. "
REAL,"As you can see, Minnesota is averaging 1,573 tests a day in April. Thats well short of the 5,000 tests/day goal @GovTimWalz set on 4/13. "
REAL,Public health experts also warn that testing alone isnt going to get us out of this. Theres a need for surveillance experts and contact tracers to pinpoint outbreaks and limit the spread. But those public health workers have been cut across the country too.
REAL,"Half the states &amp; Washington D.C. cut public health funding between '08 and '18, according to data from @SHADAC. How do those cuts translate to workers? Adriane Casalotti with @NACCHOalerts said 23% of the local public health workforce, 56,000 people, were cut over that time."

Reporting the outbreaks

There are many websites around the world keeping us posted about the progress of the Covid-19 virus, about the number of people infected, the number of people that died of the virus "
REAL,"and mortality percentages, showing interesting maps. 

Interestingly, however concrete those numbers appear to be, its good to ask questions about the why and how behind those figures and in that I see a parallel with "
REAL,"African Swine Fever outbreaks which Pig Progress has been following intensively.

For example  can people be infected with Covid-19 yet barely notice it? If so, that would mean that the virus could be much more widespread than is actually reported, "
REAL,"meaning that the real mortality figure is much lower.

Extremely interesting in this context I find is the way in which authorities have behaved in recent years with the reporting of ASF outbreaks. 

I have come to understand that accurately reporting ASF outbreaks depends on "
REAL,"a gigantic mix of components, just to name a few:

Availability of test kits;

Presence of necessary diagnostics infrastructure, including labs;

Availability of funding for affected farmers;

Availability of educated manpower to process all information; "
REAL,"Knowledge about the virus;

Sense of responsibility for others;

Cultural attitudes with regard to transparency in case of large problems;

Corruption;

Protection of export interests. "
REAL,"Ive come to see that with regard to ASF, some countries have reported more outbreaks than others, in different frequencies, in different intensity, on different levels as well. 

Some did not report anything at all  or only occasional outbreaks. "
REAL,"I may have had a head start, but in case I wanted to have a reliable idea as to what numbers might be credible beyond doubt with regard to reporting coronavirus, Id first look at the countries that have been reporting ASF frequently, swiftly and without hesitation. "
REAL,"Lessons learnt with regard to Covid-19 and ASF
Lessons learnt are threefold. 

First, its never too early to start thinking about a virus at the other side of the planet (look at this Danish example). 

Secondly, lets hope the millions pumped into the vaccine business "
REAL,"to find a good Covid-19 vaccine somehow lead to a positive spin-off for pig vaccine development too. 

And last but not least, countries reporting many outbreaks are not the ones having the largest problem  they in fact are the ones sharing the most information. "

A thread on #CrudeOil 

A brief explaination of WTI and Brent crude"
REAL,"Oil markets witnessed a historic moment on Monday when WTI crude for May delivery fell more than 100 percent, settling at around -$37/bbl indicating that producers would have to pay traders to take oil off them."
REAL,"WTI is extracted from oil fields in the United States. It is primarily extracted in Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota and is then transported via pipeline to Cushing, Oklahoma for delivery. Cushing was a major spot for oil for decades, and has been the delivery spot for contracts"
REAL,"Brent crude is extracted from oil fields in the North Sea. Brent Crude refers to a blend of four crude oils - Brent, Forties, Osberg, and Ekofisk which together are known as BFOE. It contains 0.37% of sulfur. Brent futures contracts are traded on the Intercontinental Exchange"
REAL,"Why did WTI futures fall so much?

Just like any other commodities, WTI has future contracts expiring every month. For WTI, the current month expiry was on April 21. Also, remember these contracts have to be settled physically."
REAL,"This means the buyer of a futures contract will have to take delivery of physical crude, if he is still holding the contract at expiry. This delivery is to be taken at Cushing. There are also speculators who have not contracted for storage of the incoming crude."
REAL,"However, considering the times we are in, there were no buyers for this contract due to sharp fall in oil demand in the US and also globally. Refiners do not have enough capacity to the store the crude, airlines and transport is shut."
REAL,"Why does Brent not fall so much?
Brent futures expire on April 30. The sell off seen in WTI is not happening in Brent simply because Brent crude contracts settle in cash. Thus, any speculator can take them to their expiry without being forced to sell at any price unlike WTI"
REAL,"Another reason is that Brent Brent essentially draws its oil from more than a dozen oil fields located in the North Sea. It is close to water and hence can be stored in tankers, while WTI, because of its landlocked nature, is quite far from the nearest water body."
REAL,"Why is Brent preferred over WTI?

WTI usually trades at discount to brent. WTI is the benchmark for oil prices in the US, while the rest of the world - and nearly two-thirds of all oil contracts traded - are on Brent. This makes Brent the global benchmark."
REAL,"@deepvaluepubs Maybe it depends on amounts. If the contracts they held were for vastly larger storage amounts they thought wasn't worth to do it piecemeal (I'm just thinking out loud).

REAL,"@cyrusnelson It wasn't reported it was futures, and here, the price has dropped, but then it has stayed the same at around $2.29. if you have a membership card to some business, it's a little cheaper."
REAL,We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know  and were experiencing right now!  the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods.
REAL,"Im with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take care of people we dont know  all of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served."
REAL,"Is the problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldnt have the homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers and smartphones, that we already have."
REAL,The problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is inertia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things. The problem is regulatory capture.
REAL,"We need to want new companies to build these things, even if incumbents dont like it, even if only to force the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is will. We need to build these things."
REAL,"And we need to separate the imperative to build these things from ideology and politics. Both sides need to contribute to building. The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place."
REAL,"The right is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that hold back market-based competition and the building of things."
REAL,"The right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly) innovation."
REAL,"Its time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward."
REAL,"The left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that the public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing."
REAL,"Stop trying to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future. Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results."
REAL,"Instead of taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge  build new things and show the results! Show that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and effective  how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes along, blow us away!"
REAL,"Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with public funding; why cant 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldnt regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build?"
REAL,"Solve the climate crisis by building  energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so lets build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?"
REAL,"In fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The things we build in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly in price. The things we dont, like housing, schools, and hospitals, skyrocket in price"
REAL,"Whats the American dream? The opportunity to have a home of your own, &amp; a family you can provide for. We need to break the rapidly escalating price curves for ing, education, &amp; healthcare, to make sure that every 'an  realize the dream, &amp; the only way to do that is to build."
REAL,"Building isnt easy, or wed already be doing all this. We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society. And we need to demand more from one another."
REAL,"Were all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building. Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building?"
REAL,"What are you building directly, or helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of people who are building?"
REAL,"If the work youre doing isnt either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, weve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building."
REAL,"There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems  we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems."
REAL,"I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Heres a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? Theres an excellent chance Ill agree with you."

REAL,This #OilPrice situation is interesting because the nebulous concept of oil futures has turned into a story about actual barrels of actual oil. 
REAL,"The issue is that with the coronavirus pandemic (among other factors), the world is producing a lot more crude oil than can be used. (Working from home/being laid off means not commuting, means you don't need that gasoline, etc.)"
REAL,"When we talk about oil prices, we're generally not talking about people buying and selling and transporting physical barrels of oil. We're talking about futures contracts -- a promise of oil to be delivered at certain dates in the future."
REAL,"As the world produces more oil than it needs, storage facilities have been filling up. "
REAL,"Today's the last day of trading on the May contract. So, generally speaking, anyone left holding the bag today has to figure out next month where to put the oil they bought."

REAL,"@ARaj_Energy The initial figure in the article, that is, 300k. Shut-ins total just 900k averaged across 2Q20 in the three major basins."
REAL,"@NatashaTurak @ARaj_Energy Indeed. Accounting for regulator announcements would have added to their analysis: specifically North Dakota's regulator has been updating all through this month. 4th April they had already shut in 175kbd. By 21st, that was 300k"
REAL,"@NatashaTurak @ARaj_Energy Now, they're talking monthly avgs, and company shutins (i.e. $CLR $COP etc) would be included in that figure. But it still points to a much larger number across L48"
REAL,@NatashaTurak @Petrologica Yeah not sure what the further declines uses as a baseline  compared to lets say Jan/Feb I see these 4 basins down comfortably over 2 mil bpd but probably not on Avg for 2Q because of phase in in April so its prob

REAL,"Q: Is now a good time to #invest?

Jackson says that now is a great time to invest, saying that ""the future is in our control."" The companies that won't survive are the ones who have just shut down and haven't sought out viable solutions, she adds."
REAL,"The same way we found ways to work during the #pandemic, we need to keep that level of agility in business, Jackson says, adding that providing insight and analyses in a digital format will be key."
REAL,"Smith jumps in, agreeing with Jackson's views and suggesting that now is a good time to seek out value in the stock market.

Embracing new #technologies and making sure that the company is harmonized digitally, and easing client-customer communication, will be essential, he adds."
REAL,"""We need to think about when everything's back to normal, whatever you're selling, there has to be two options,"" Jackson says, citing a client she has who initially shut her storefront business, then reopened a delivery service and saw her sales rise dramatically."
REAL,"Jackson's business has always been a bit 'feast or famine,' and the way that a company behaves during the lean times will define them, she says. Paying attention to trends and the up-and-downs is key."
REAL,"Smith joins in, noting that even though the tech market has received a demand boost off #coronavirus, there's still set to be some contraction, and what consumers need from these businesses has changed - and will continue to change."
REAL,"Holding your nerve and continuing to invest in innovation will be essential to survival, customer happiness and optimisation, he adds."
REAL,"In difficult times like this, being able to show clients how valuable you are is critical, Jackson says. As engagement has skyrocketed between video calls and emails, organisations have less time, and need to invest in their business - in her case, in #talent recruitment."
REAL,"Q: The idea that innovation isn't going to slow down - do you think clients are looking for more updates, reviewing systems, or will there be a drive towards new products and services?"
REAL,"Smith says it'll likely be a mix of things, adding that organisations who are responding, refocusing and looking at their place in the market critically will be ahead of the game."
REAL,"Jackson adds that it's quite difficult to go back to 'normal,' and that people will likely resist digitalisation over job concerns. She's seen the #legal sector change as they resist tech like smart contracts, and suggests that change should be driven forward for the better."
REAL,"Q: With so many unknowns, how can you manage expectations and projections?

Smith says that rolling forecasts and scenario planning/analysis are important for organisations to get on top of, and that they should look at both optimistic and pessimistic forecasting."
REAL,"This is the time to have scenario planning, Jackson chimes in, suggesting that this is the time to bin year-long budgets and look at things in the shorter term. Having a ""start-up mentality"" and looking closely at projections and forecasts will be useful."
REAL,"Q: We're arguably in a false #economy, with all the government support. What's your reaction to the UK government's intervention?

Smith says the measures, from the financial perspective, were announced quickly, but there are still challenges for fledgling businesses."
REAL,"Jackson concurs, saying the speed of the government's economic action has been better than other countries' work. She says that while it did help calm the nation and support the business ecosystem, they should now move to looking at projections and repayment."
REAL,"Q: Does it seem like regulators will be sympathetic to the current situation?

Smith says it's hard to say and it will depend on industry. There's a pragmatic approach by all regulators in terms of not making things overly onerous in extraordinary times, he says."
REAL,"Moving on to audience questions, McCaw asks Smith how to risk manage quickly and assess new suppliers.

Smith says onboarding isn't always a quick process, but customers come first and sourcing can take some innovation. Cutting through processes and being pragmatic is useful."
REAL,"Jackson says that cash is king, and while her cost base has always been quite low, they're focused on income, costs and managing that overall #cashflow."
REAL,"Q: Within your industry, do you think costs will be pushed down across the board?

Jackson says that she's had to consider things in a far different light, and that people are challenging everything along that #costbase. She suggests that everyone will have to become more agile."
REAL,"How have you seen client's talent needs change?

Jackson says companies are seeking out analytical talent and recommends that anyone with job insecurity take advantage of free, online courses to hone soft, technical and management skills."
REAL,"That brings us to the end of our Live Discussion, and we'd like to give another thank you to Robert Smith and Yemi Jackson for joining us today.

REAL,"Today I want to talk about contract tracing, which is one of the most critical tools we have to reduce our spread rate, speed up our diagnoses and seek to halt outbreaks before they happen."
REAL,"Lets start with the basics: What is contract tracing? 

It's a system to make sure you get notified if you had contact with someone who has tested positive for #COVID19  so you can do whats necessary to keep you, your family and your community safe."
REAL,"In order to move safely back toward normalcy, Illinois, the United States, and frankly the whole world must contract trace on a never-before-seen scale.

This is an unprecedented public health challenge  so we need an unprecedented solution to meet the moment."
REAL,"To do that, Illinois will be building on our existing infrastructure and expertise to shape a massive statewide contact tracing operation  gradually building over the coming weeks, and then scaling up an army of contact tracers by the hundreds and then thousands."
REAL,"Based on our current rates of spread, were looking at a benchmark that could approach 30 workers per 100,000 residents  but to be clear, that number can and will diminish if we see greater success in our public health measures, like our face-covering requirement."
REAL,"Already, weve identified groups of Illinois residents to quickly scale up our efforts: undergraduate and graduate students, volunteers, retired health professionals, local health officials, community health workers and new hires. All of them are heroes."
REAL,"When someone tests positive for COVID-19, a contract tracer will reach out to them through an app, email, text or phone call. 

Because not everybody can or will use this technology, some will require follow up with a safe in-person visit if you cant be reached in another way."
REAL,"In step 2: we'll interview the COVID-positive person, asking them to gather their contacts &amp; retrace their steps over the past 14 days. 

We'll then notify the contacts that they've been in proximity to a positive case, recommend testing &amp; self-isolation, and offer resources."
REAL,"Privacy is an important aspect of maintaining trust in contact tracing, so to be clear, contacts will remain anonymous."
REAL,"Remember, we arent reinventing the wheel here.

Contact tracing has been done in every pandemic and major outbreak for many years. 

Our efforts will lead to an all-around healthier Illinois."
REAL,"Just rolled my eyes so hard it gave me a splitting headache. 

Yes, if the pandemic is still shutting down schools and the economy, Im sure there will be a TON of organized service opportunities that are safe, fulfilling and appropriate.

 "
REAL,One issue this highlights is a coronavirus management strategy that has bn little discussed but it's just possible that we managed to execute it in the UK. It's a bit complicated to get the wet towel around your head. Let's begin... 
REAL,"Suppose the following were true.
1) I thought I'd had too many cases to eradicate by preventing almost any spread, Korea or NZ-style, but I did still want to eradicate rather than achieve herd immunity.+"
REAL,"2) Next, suppose I did some behavioural analysis &amp; decided people would modify their behaviour a lot for a short time &amp; a bit for a longer time. And suppose my models said that ""a bit"" would take the R0 down to some number - let's say 1.5."
REAL,"With these two assumptions in place, the following strategy might be implementable.
We allow sufficient spread that after the period where we have strong containment, the R0 of the longer-sustained modified behaviour means the herd immunity threshold lies below the % infected.+"
REAL,"Then we encourage society to maintain the modified behaviour for long enough (and it may not take that long) that the disease can then be eradicated via case isolation etc, NZ-style.+"
REAL,"What am I saying. Let's put it crudely. Suppose the herd immunity threshold were 60%. I could wait until 10% were infected, then lock down until 25% had been infected. Then if I could keep the R0 to 1.2, R would be below 1 (given we'd be above herd immunity) &amp; it wld die out."
REAL,"With those numbers it sounds hard, but suppose I got lucky &amp; it turned out a further 20% of the population were immune for some reason. Then I have 45% immune. So if my behaviour-modified R0 is below 1.8 I'll achieve eradication if I can keep it up.+"
REAL,"@andrew_lilico By that I mean they were delaying as long as they possibly could to get manageable maximum infection. Like you say, whether they were thinking that far ahead then will take some time to come out."
REAL,"@NCDCgov Updated charts. 92 new cases in Kano. 2,000+ tests done yesterday - and the ramp-up of testing is yielding new cases - in high numbers and all over the country. "
REAL,"@DrAbioye @NCDCgov Lagos is doing well more people will be discharged hopefully coming weeks, the government may need to acquire school hostels and hotels for isolation, Lagos will peak early and with a highly literate population can attain a curve soon, "
REAL,@BenjaminTuti @NCDCgov I do agree with your analysis but I'll like to see the numbers in Lagos decline steadily first before I get excited.
REAL,"@alexkidman That messaging has been sounding more and more like the app is your shield against the virus, I agree its odd. But having a large percentage able to do contact tracing far beyond the manual process has huge advantages to limit the spread."
REAL,"@trentontheradio @GQuattromani @alexkidman It's beyond the selling. 

The app is flawed, and the government selling the app is untrustworthy.

My standards don't fall down this low; sorry."
REAL,"The State of Washington is poor, and @GovInslee is to blame.

We were the first to lock down, and we are remaining almost entirely locked down until at least May 31.

Inslee is using five metrics to keep us locked down, but only two of them really matter, and both are good. &gt; "
REAL,"The most important is Disease Activity. Obviously, we have a ways to go, but the most important thing to realize is that people *are* out in public and at stores, and we *have* massively improved on this metric. Cases are way down over a month ago. &gt;"
REAL,"The other important one is Health Care System Readiness, because if another outbreak happens, we need to be able to handle it. Inslee says none of the five metrics are good, but this one is actually so good, that we tore down a temp facility and gave it away. &gt;"
REAL,"Then there is Risk to Vulnerable Populations, which is not unimportant, but you can simply keep the long-term care facilities locked down. Problem solved.

Then theres the two metrics that *have no business* keeping us locked down: testing and contact tracing. &gt;"
REAL,"Inslee has four phases of reopening, but the first phase is that you can go do outdoor activities and be near your immediate family. So it is no different from now, really. We never should have locked those down in the first place. &gt;

"
REAL,"What we should do is simple, and what many others are doing: roll out phase TWO on May 4. If we see no significant increase in hospitalizations, roll out phase THREE on May 18, followed by phase FOUR on June 1.

He has us slated for phase FOUR around July 6. &gt;"
REAL,"We do not need testing or contact tracing to do this: we just need to be responsive and roll back quickly if we see a spikes.

Yes, that would suck to roll back, but I think Inslees plan sucks a lot more."
REAL,"Yes, we could do more testing to find out how bad we are, earlier. Yes, contact tracing helps mitigate when we have more cases that come up.

But these are things that help if the problem gets worse. Right now, it is getting better. Why stay locked down? It is just fear. &gt;"

REAL,"As someone who spent multiple ARSDs evading posting pictures of my face because I don't have confidence in that bish, here are some ideas for ARSDs that don't involve posting a picture of yourself!"
REAL,Make a photo edit or drawing to go with a theme like you normally would for an ARSD.
REAL,You can post a picture of yourself with strong backlighting so that there's just a silhouette or a photo taken from a distance so that you can't see your face properly.

Legal experts recommend, Devise a backup plan now, even if you arent sick. Because #COVID will be here to stay for a while, its likely that more and more families will be facing this scenario at some point in the future:"
REAL,"(4/8)
1. Make a list of family and friends that would be willing to step in. 
Talk to them about it early because they may need time to weigh the risk of being infected themselves.
 Ideal caregivers have been infected and have recovered, but this isnt always an option. "

2. Once a temporary guardian has been identified, formalize the arrangement in writing. If both parents are on a ventilator, for example, and the child get sick, someone will need to legally consent for their medical care."

but chief white pushes back:  says its an MISNOMER to think there is an arrest on every complaint..."
REAL,"now @HelenRosenthal follows up on @NYCSpeakerCoJo's original quesiton ref why there aren't arrests effected w every #DV complaint taken.
@NYPDDV says if person is on-site still, and its a felony #DV complaint or violation of an order of protection that they are arrested. "
REAL,".@HelenRosenthal now presses @NYPDDV chief #Kathleen White ref # of #DomesticViolence complaints dropping during #COVID19 pandemic but we don't get a clear answer.

REAL,"A P.S. that may be useful for people: when using social media, only be as open as you feel comfortable. This means, some people may want to lock their Twitter account to feel safer and experiment.

REAL,"Other people choose to ""stay on brand"" all the time. I don't. I also don't always tweet about water, waste, comparative politics, social movements theory, commons and polycentricity. Sometimes I tweet about music, Ryan Reynolds/James Franco, or ask for recipes online."

That is 200K more positive pts &amp; 15K more deaths than this time last WEEK.
Science's job is not to make you feel better; it's to provide FACTS.
Please read on. "
REAL,4/ I'm not sure there will ever be any *good* news about #COVID19. It has illustrates how EVERYONE is interrelated/connected; &amp; EVERYONE is at risk. This virus is agnostic in whom it infects; but there are huge inequities in how different people have access to treatment and care.
REAL,"7/ And if it is someone at work/apt complex/etc-it is the same principles:
-wear a mask in public places
-maintain social distancing
-wash your hands: w/sanitizer after touching shared surfaces (elevator buttons, doorknobs, etc); soap &amp; water whenever possible
-don't touch face."
REAL,"8/How are we going to beat this?
First: REALLY smart people (MUCH smarter than me!) are working around the clock around the world.
At .@Penn we have 21 clinical trials incl a vaccine trial!
But be prepared: MANY trials *don't work.*
So what else can we do?
"
REAL,"9/ First: #StayHome  
We've all seen the graphics of ""flattening the curve.""
This does is give us a break-a chance to catch our breaths and get ahead of it.
It gives healthcare professionals a chance to focus on the truly sick.
And for that: THANK YOU.
"
REAL,"10/ But this is not enough-not NEARLY enough.
And if we re-open too early; if we don't add additional measures to contain and control this until we get a treatment or vaccine, we WILL see a second surge.
We know this from other experiences.
"
REAL,"11/ What we need is a 5-point approach that has worked for other countries: social distancing, contact tracing, testing, isolation, and treatment.
Certain states are starting this already.
Unfortunately, other states-and our Fed govt-are not.
"
REAL,"12/Also, plz realize: #Covid19 didn't break America. It is revealing what is already broken. It is:
-highlighting the inequities that exist in healthcare
-exposing how little protection healthcare workers have
-exposing sig lack of healthcare for Americans
"
REAL,"13/ Ok, let's dispel a few myths:
First: breathing/holding breath does NOT confirm/deny that you have #Covid19...and you can pass out. So please don't do this. "
REAL,"14/ Another myth? That doctors/hospitals get more $ for saying a deceased pt was covid-positive, thereby artifically inflating the numbers.
This is ABSOLUTELY untrue
And in fact: because of lack of testing, we're seeing a spike in pneumonia-deaths

REAL,"In order to keep us safe and slow the spread, I have been under a ""work from home"" mandate since March 16.

From the start of the outbreak, AT&amp;T has provided 80, and in some cases, 160 hours of paid sick leave or ""quarantine"" time for those who get COVID-19,"

REAL,"2.We have, more or less, faced most of it on our own.  That is not to say that there have not been support services out there to which we were referred along the years but the services which they have had available for us have been incomplete and unreliable."
REAL,6.Mark started first and has had an uncomfortable week with a snooty nose and cough but no temperature.  We have self isolated and isolated him internally in the house but were confident about having the night staff in because we felt that it was not Corona.
REAL,"7.After 7 days both me and my daughter started showing symptoms of a cough and sore throat.  Mine is controllable with paracetamol but Sarah  as with any ENT bug, has ended up with a bad chest immediately."
REAL,"8.She is having difficulty in breathing and we are in contact with our GP about medicating her with increased Asthma medication, saline, Anti-biotics and steroids which is out normal approach to a chest infection."
REAL,"9.There is no point in her going into hospital, she will not be provided with any care over and above what we are giving except that she will be very distressed about not being in familiar surroundings."
REAL,10.We are not stupid and we live with the constant knowledge that any infection could result in her death but we would like it to be as gentle and comfortable as possible.
REAL, hospital will put her on a ventilator because others will be deemed more clinically important and in any case her end of life plan is already written.
REAL,13.Indeed they deserve to be able to make the decision about whether they want to be involved in her care or not  they do not get paid well enough to put their lives in danger.  Why are there no tests being done in the community?
REAL,14.2)PPE  neither ourselves or the paid staff who are caring for her have masks or disposable clothing to prevent them from taking the virus  if that indeed is what it is  out of the house and back to their own homes.  I realise that the NHS is challenged in this area already
REAL,15.We are trying to relieve the burden by coping with this at home without recourse to precious hospital beds.  It would not be the right place for Sarah from every angle.
REAL,16.Please will you ask at PMQs why we are so badly prepared and when the resources are going to be able to reach past the wards into the homes of those who are supporting the vulnerable and elderly?

REAL,"COVID-19 Among Workers in Meat and Poultry Processing Facilities  19 States, April 2020 "
REAL,Sociocultural and economic challenges to COVID-19 prevention in meat and poultry processing facilities include accommodating the needs of workers from diverse backgrounds who speak different primary languages; one facility reported a workforce with 40 primary languages.
REAL,"Facility challenges included structural and operational practices that made it difficult to maintain a 6-foot (2-meter) distance while working, especially on production lines, and in nonproduction settings during breaks and while entering and exiting facilities."
REAL,"The pace and physical demands of processing work made adherence to face covering recommendations difficult, with some workers observed covering only their mouths and frequently readjusting their face coverings while working."
REAL,Some sites were also observed to have difficulty adhering to the heightened cleaning and disinfection guidance recommended for all worksites to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
REAL,"To shield workers from various hazards in meat &amp; poultry processing facilities, the preferred approaches are to eliminate a hazard or exposure source, install engineering controls &amp; implement effective sanitation &amp; cleaning; enhanced administrative measures might also be needed."

REAL,"** lag time in reporting to the local &amp; state health departments also affects the counts reported, as does time from disease onset to death in fatal cases. Finally, widespread community transmission in some settings makes determining the source of exposure and infection difficult"
REAL,Facility barriers to effective prevention and control of COVID-19 included difficulty distancing workers at least 6 feet (2 meters) from one another (2) and in implementing COVID-19-specific disinfection guidelines
REAL,"socioeconomic challenges might contribute to working while feeling ill, particularly if there are management practices such as bonuses that incentivize attendance."
REAL,Solutions to structural and operational challenges that some facilities adopted included adjusting start and stop times of shifts and breaks to increase physical distance between workers. Outdoor break areas were added at some facilities to decrease contact between workers.
REAL,"Some facilities installed physical (e.g., plexiglass) bar riers between workers; however, this was not practical for all worker functions. Symptom and temperature screening of workers was newly instituted in some facilities and improved in others."

REAL,"Now more than ever, we need to understand how young people search for help *online*... 

Is it different to help-seeking in offline settings (e.g. in school/family/care settings)? 

What do young people say about this? And how can we inform design? "
REAL,"Thread re. recent paper led by @DettePretorius:

Big survey (n=1308) of 18-25 year olds on help-seeking scenarios. Results informed creation of 3 groupings to illustrate online help-seeking behaviours:

1) Information-seeker
2) Person-centred
3) Crisis-situation"
REAL,"2) Person-centred: goes online to gain a sense of relatedness with others through a variety of means - i.e., personal stories/vlogs.  &lt;--(not escapism or avoidance)

3) Crisis-situation: immediate need for on/offline help to address in-situ distress."
REAL,"These 3 groupings were then used to make 'personas' from which co-design workshops with 35 young people occurred. 

So what did young people say about these personas and how would they then design appropriate technologies to assist help-seeking online?"
REAL,"CONCLUSION: we can enhance online help-seeking process by providing:
1) Opportunities for connectedness 
2) Credible and accessible  information  
3) Personalisation, but also respect autonomy
4) Just-in-time support options

REAL,"You've no doubt seen talk about ""reopening"" the country. In Georgia, it's even happening. Is this a good idea? We say that we need more testing in order to know. We definitely need more testing, but even that has limitations in preventing the spread of #COVID19. Why?

A thread."
REAL,A super important thing to know up front is that when we talk about the COVID test we are really talking about a set of different tests that have varying ability to detect a current or past infection. I wrote a thread about that here: 
REAL,"While some tests are more sensitive than others, none of them are perfect. We dont know how long after becoming infected before a person can spread the virus to others, but we do know that none of the nasal swab tests can detect infection immediately."
REAL,"You can think of this similarly to pregnancy tests. When someone becomes pregnant, their body ramps up production of a key hormone called hCG, and that is what a pregnancy test is detecting. However, it takes some time for the level to get to the point that it can be detected."
REAL,"This is why even the most sensitive of tests cant tell someone if theyre pregnant until several days after they become pregnant. Same goes for infections. When someone is first infected, it starts with a small number of virus molecules, and then those replicate over time."
REAL,"Different nasal swab tests will be able to detect and diagnose an infection at varying times post-infection, but all of them take some time. And, just like how youre either pregnant or youre not, youre either infected or youre not, independent of what the test says."
REAL,"So, where does this leave us? Are the tests useless? Definitely not! Its just critical that we understand their limitations. If you get a positive test result, theres a good chance you have the virus and should get treated and isolate yourself."
REAL,"But, if you get a negative result (and especially if you have symptoms) this does not mean you can safely go about normal life without still having some risk of spreading the virus. You might just be too early in the infection to test positive."
REAL,"The blood test is important since we dont currently know how many people have been infected and just didnt have symptoms. Right now, the data suggest that people who have had COVID-19 cannot get it again, so the blood test might tell how many people are immune."
REAL,"As we talk about reopening, its important to realize that getting back to normal should probably mean starting up with a new normal. If we care about the most vulnerable people in our population, we need to realize the risks that no test can fully eliminate."

REAL,"we... literally cannot test for immunity, though.... "
REAL,"You can do COVID-19 diagnostics through other methods (sputum instead of pharyngeal-laryngeal swabs, or CT scans), which have a higher sensitivity, but still only test for active infection."
REAL,"There are two companies currently developing an antigen test, which would test for someone who has had an infection in the past. However, seroconversion for SARS-CoV-2 takes about two weeks, so there's a lag."
REAL,"Furthermore, it's *not* currently known whether it is possible to be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 (ie, to get COVID-19 twice).

We hope not, but this is *not* known."
REAL,"In other words, even if we had a mass-produced SARS-CoV-2 antibody test today, it would not actually test for immunity against COVID-19. Because we don't know if antibodies provide immunity, or even resistance."
REAL,"There are plenty of viruses for which past infections produce detectable antibodies, but for which the antibodies don't provide meaningful levels of protection against reinfection.

Is SARS-CoV-2 one of them? We don't know."
REAL,"Based on some studies of *other* coronaviruses, people are speculating that antibodies provide at least partial protection against reinfection for SARS-CoV-2.

However, that relies on a lot of assumptions, any one of which could be incorrect. Again, as of today, we don't know."
REAL,"PCR testing is important for other reasons, and antigen testing will be important for a different set of reasons. But it is dangerously misleading to imply that we can test for immunity against COVID-19, or that we expect to be able to in the future.

We can't count on it."
REAL,"And the phase ""testing to show who has had the virus and is immune"" is especially dangerous because it implies that people who have had the virus are immune.

This is one of the biggest open questions at the moment about COVID-19! It's not something we can assume or rely on!!"
REAL,"Again: no matter what the intention, it is really harmful to have politicians spreading misconceptions or misinformation about COVID-19 during the middle of a pandemics. People take actions based on the information they hear, and misinformation literally has the power to kill."
REAL,"People who have cleared COVID-19 could still be susceptible to another case. They *could* also still carry the virus and infect someone else.

(We don't know yet that they cannot, so we must assume that they can, because many common viruses do work this way)."
REAL,"If we find out otherwise at some point... that's wonderful! But it'll be a while before we know that. In the absolute *best* case, we're talking on the order of a couple of months, not a couple of days or a couple of weeks."
REAL,"so at best, telling people that social distancing will end because of immunity testing is a false sense of hope - in reality, there's no way people will still be social distancing by the time we have hard data on whether immunity testing is even possible"
REAL,"Literally, for all we know, SARS-CoV-2 could be like influenza, which mutates rapidly enough that immunity against previous years don't protect (much) against the current year.

We won't know if that's true or not with certainty until fall 2020 at earliest."
REAL,"Yes, I am spelling out the most cautious set of assumptions, not the most optimistic ones. But caution is exactly what we need from elected officials during a global pandemic. We can't be placing our bets, or our hopes, on a course of action that could destroy us if we're wrong."
REAL,@chimeracoder iirc they're working on antibody testing as well and are very very close to it

REAL,@Cards502 @ericcrawford I don't see why PCR-based detection is necessary. A patient with antibodies capable of detecting a unique antigen is pretty likely to be positive and PCR's can give false positive as well.
REAL,"@Cards502 @ericcrawford I understand that, but it's a novel virus so how many people you think are lining up to get tested that were exposed and have cleared the virus?"

REAL,"15/19 The recent public focus on whether 100,000 tests will be performed on April 30 is a red herring - it's just an isolated measure of capacity at a single point in time. It's therefore a distraction from the key issue of how testing strategy needs to develop."
REAL,"16/19 All six questions outlined above are just as important tomorrow, irrespective of whether 75,000, 90,000 or 100,000 tests are performed today. Trust leaders are also worried that the 100,000 tests by April 30 target is distorting the testing regime in three key ways."
REAL,"17/19 1. ""100k tests by April 30"" focus risks diverting energy from development of proper, next stage, testing strategy. 2. It may be driving testing for testings sake  maximising  tests on April 30 - as opposed to ensuring each test done for right purpose and delivers value."
REAL,"18/19 3. The current focus on ""100k tests by April 30"" may also be placing too great a priority on the number of tests completed, as opposed to whether those who should be tested can actually get a test when required. This is the most important priority."
