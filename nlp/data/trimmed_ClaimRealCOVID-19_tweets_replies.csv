Contacts are then notified of their potential exposure and told to be vigilant for symptoms. Contacts are recommended to get tested or self-isolate for a given amount of time."

It is pretty much impossible to eat with a facemask on but is rather easy to wear one while walking. So risk is mitigated, it doesn't mean risk is zero. Does that help?"
