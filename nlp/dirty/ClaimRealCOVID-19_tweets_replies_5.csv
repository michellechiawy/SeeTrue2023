REAL,"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 

1/3"
REAL,"Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 

2/3"
REAL,"Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

3/3"
REAL,"How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

1/3"
REAL,"These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

2/3"
REAL,"People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

3/3"
REAL,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air."
REAL,"Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

""We're fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu.""
""If we're familiar with it, it's less scary to us."""
REAL,"She notes because COVID-19 is so new, there's little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine."

REAL,"Ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces. The virus is transmitted person-to-person. She says that can include being in close quarters with someone, simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets."

REAL,"Reiterating a point made previous, people most at risk are those 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions.
She said children diagnosed with coronavirus 19 years and under are ""doing very well.""

""For our children it sounds like God has smiled on us."""
REAL,"Now talking about ""flattening the curve."" People are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections.

""This is not here today and gone tomorrow."" -Feldschau"
REAL,"Ulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would ""tax our healthcare system."" Should the city/county get there, it would have to look at ""alternative"" ways to treat people. She didn't expand on what those alternatives are."
REAL,She said that's one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up.

REAL,"1. Fill in the Facts

Turn off the news and really find out what your kids know about the virus.  Answer their questions, and if you donâ€™t know the answer, be honest. You can research the answers together."
REAL,"4. Manage Your Own Anxiety
Anxious parents are more likely to have anxious teenagers. Wittingly or not, parents are sometimes fearful in a way that puts their children on edge."
REAL,"Teenagers can tell when adults are saying one thing and feeling another. Offering reassuring words wonâ€™t do much good when our own anxiety is riding high.

Before trying to support a fretful teenager, tense adults should take steps to calm their own nerves."
REAL,Here are some answers you may need to have at your fingertips about  #CoronaVirus or #COVIDãƒ¼19 as the teens would rather call it.
REAL,"How contagious is the virus?

It seems to spread easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and confined spaces. The pathogen travel through the air, enveloped in tiny respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes."
REAL,"Where has the virus spread?

The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 124,000 in at least 108 countries and more than 4,500 have died. World Health Organization officials said the outbreak qualifies as a global pandemic."
REAL,"What symptoms should I look out for?

Symptoms, can take two to 14 days to appear, include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Milder cases may resemble bad cold, but people may be able to pass on virus even before they develop symptoms."
REAL,"How do I keep myself and others safe?

Washing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when youâ€™re sick and avoiding touching your face."
REAL,"How long will it take to develop a treatment or vaccine?

Several drugs are being tested, and some initial findings are expected soon. A vaccine to stop the spread is still at least a year away."

REAL,"I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.

It's a #Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A."
REAL,"What is COVID-19? 

COVID-19 is the INFECTIOUS disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.

This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
REAL,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.

Some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms."
REAL,"Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. 

People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
REAL,"How does COVID-19 spread? 

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales."
REAL,"How likely am I to catch COVID-19? 

The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there."
REAL,"Should I worry about COVID-19? 

Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. 

It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones."
REAL,"Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work."
REAL,"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized."
REAL,"Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19."
REAL,"Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask."
REAL,"Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19."
REAL,"Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics."
REAL,"In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

REAL,"Q. What is COVID-19?
A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."

A. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. #coronavirus"
REAL,"Q. How fatal is COVID-19?
A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing."
REAL,"[2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people with the disease have died. #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirusindia"
REAL,"Q. How does COVID-19 spreads?
A. [1/3] People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. #CoronaVirusUpdates"
REAL,"[2/3] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. #CoronaAlert #coronavirus"
REAL,[3/3] People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. #coronavirusindia
REAL,"Q. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
A. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  #coronavirus #coronovirusindia"
REAL,"Q. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
A. [1/2] The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. But many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms in the early stages."
REAL,"[2/2] It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who might be infected but has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. #Corona #coronavirusindia"

REAL,"Q3: What is serological antibody test in the context of COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2?
A3: Blood is taken from the veins and the serum/plasma put to a test to know whether the person has developed antibodies against the virus, SARS-COV-2, for the disease, COVID-19."
REAL,"Q4: How long it takes to give the result of the serological antibody test?
A4: It takes 15-30 minutes to get the result of the test. So, it is a rapid diagnostic test (RDT)."
REAL,"Q5: Who would have developed antibodies against SARS-COV-2/COVID-19?
 A5: Only people who were infected by SARS-COV-2 and had the disease COVID-19 are likely to have developed antibodies against SARS-COV-2/COVID-19."
REAL,"Q6: Why is the test conducted on population who are not known to have COVID-19?
A6: Some people might have been infected but were either asymptomatic or were with symptoms but have not been tested. Hence, the test is conducted on population who are not known to have it."
REAL,"Q7:  Why the test has been initiated in Bhubaneswar, not in other cities of Odisha?
A7: As Bhubaneswar has been declared as a hotspot and there is likelihood for the rapid spread in the city and from the city to other cities, the test has been initiated in Bhubaneswar."
REAL,"Q8: What is the purpose of the test?
A8:  The purpose of the test is to help in disease surveillance. It will help us arrive at an estimate of how many people from different categories of population in Bhubaneswar that might have been affected."
REAL,"Q9:  Apart from random sampling for testing the population, who else can go for the antibody test?
A9: Samples of people with Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and Influenza like Illness (ILI) are also being collected apart from random sampling of asymptomatic people."
REAL,"Q10: Who will identify the population and design the sample to be tested?
A10: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) through experts from the health department have developed protocols for identifying population from among whom the sample is to be drawn for testing."
REAL,"Q11: What will happen if the antibody test comes positive?
A11: If the antibody test comes positive, the personâ€™s swab samples may be sent for RT-PCR test. This is another confirmatory test to know whether the person is currently suffering from COVID-19."
REAL,"Q.12: Will serological antibody test help identify a person suffering from COVID-19?
A12: No, as per current practise and guidelines from @WHO &amp; @ICMRDELHI, COVID-19 +ve cases are to be identified through RT-PCR in designated laboratories/testing centres."
REAL,"Q13: Will identifying people who have developed antibodies be helpful in treatment for those who are suffering from COVID-19?
A13:  An independent research protocol has to be developed where plasma from those who developed antibodies can be used to treat patients."
REAL,"Q14: Will those identified with antibodies for COVID-19 be immune from the disease?
A14: Further research with people who have already developed antibodies will be required."
REAL,"Q.15: Whom should the residents of the city contact for the test?
A15: The residents of the city may contact their respective RWA (Resident Welfare Association), Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) or ward officer for the test."
REAL,"Q16: Where from these rapid kits have come to the state?
A16: These rapid kits have been procured by @ICMRDELHI and have been supplied to Odisha."
REAL,"Q17: How many rapid kits have been provided to Government of Odisha in the first phase?
A17: @ICMRDELHI has provided 6000 rapid kits for the test to Odisha in the first phase.

REAL,"What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19."

COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
REAL,"Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with

REAL,"Part 19

droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.

Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT"

REAL,"How does coronavirus spread?

The coronavirus is thought to spread mainly from person to person. This can happen between people who are in close contact with one another. Droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes"
REAL,"may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs.
Coronavirus can also spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects. For example,"
REAL,"a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes."
REAL,"When are people most contagious?

People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic. However, there have been reports of coronavirus spreading before people show symptoms."
REAL,"Preliminary research of individuals who developed mild disease also suggests that they could be contagious early in the course of their illness, even before they have experienced symptoms or are only experiencing mild symptoms."
REAL,"How deadly is COVID-19?

The answer depends on whether you're looking at the fatality rate (the risk of death among those who are infected) or the total number of deaths. So far, influenza has caused far more deaths this flu season, both in the US and worldwide, than COVID-19."
REAL,"This is why you may have heard it said that the flu is a bigger threat.

Regarding the fatality rate, it appears that the risk of death after the pandemic coronavirus infection (estimated at 3% to 4%) is less than it was for SARS (11%) and MERS (35%),"
REAL,"but may be higher than the risk from seasonal flu (0.1%). However, the numbers circulating right now for this new coronavirus are likely to be adjusted over time, as more people are tested and reporting becomes more consistent."
REAL,"For example, testing has been limited at the start of the outbreak, which could result in fewer identified cases, making it seem as though a larger percentage of infections are fatal."
REAL,"In fact, a recent New England Journal of Medicine report states that the fatality rate of the new coronavirus infection ""may be considerably less than 1%."""
REAL,"Who is at highest risk for getting very sick from COVID-19?

Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like chronic bronchitis, emphysema, heart failure, or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness."
REAL,"Are kids immune to the virus that causes COVID-19?

Children, including very young children, can develop COVID-19. However, children tend to experience milder symptoms such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Some children have had severe complications,"
REAL,but this has been less common. Children with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe illness.
REAL,"Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?

Some viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more when the weather is colder. But it is still possible to become sick with these viruses during warmer months."
REAL,"At this time, we do not know whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather warms up."
REAL,"Should I accept packages from China?

There is no reason to suspect that packages from China harbor coronavirus. Remember, this is a respiratory virus similar to the flu. We don't stop receiving packages from China during their flu season."
REAL,"Can I catch the coronavirus by eating food handled or prepared by others?

We are still learning about transmission of the new coronavirus. It's not clear if it can be spread by an infected person through food they have handled or prepared,"
REAL,but if so it would more likely be the exception than the rule.
REAL,"That said, the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus known to spread by upper respiratory secretions, including airborne droplets after coughing or sneezing. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in the stool of certain people."
REAL,"So we currently cannot rule out the possibility of the infection being transmitted through food by an infected person who has not thoroughly washed their hands. In the case of hot food, the virus would likely be killed by cooking."
REAL,This may not be the case with uncooked foods like salads or sandwiches
REAL,"What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to"
REAL,more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19
REAL,These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
REAL,"Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness."
REAL,"People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
REAL,"How does COVID-19 spread?
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. T"
REAL,"These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets"

REAL,COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
REAL,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?"
REAL,"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms."
REAL,"This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill."
REAL,"You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water."
REAL,"Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why?"
REAL,"When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why?"
REAL,"Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene."
REAL,"This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why?"
REAL,"Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance."
REAL,"Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility."
REAL,"This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places â€“ especially if you are an older person or have++"

coronaviruses differ?

The main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause. The first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium, while Sars and Mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity."
REAL,"How do viruses work?
A virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate. It enters the cell through binding with receptors and â€œreprogrammes itâ€ to make copies of itself, working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body."
REAL,"The virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen, but that's why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people. Washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection."

REAL,"How deadly is the new coronavirus compared to Sars, Mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold?
We cannot determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak, because a lot of mild cases are missed."
REAL,"Also, with Covid-19, some people can be asymptomatic - meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded.

The mortality rate for influenza is 0.1 per cent, but since Covid-19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal."
REAL,"It is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications, influenza kills 500,000 people. Compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses, the mortality rate for Sars-Cov-2 is higher."
REAL,"Although compared to Sars (9.6 per cent) and Mers (34.4 per cent), Covid-19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread, making the total number of deaths larger."
REAL,"Can summer, or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus?
For some respiratory viruses this does happen. Not because of the temperature, but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings. In this case, it is still premature to say."

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you Â are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around"

REAL,"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

Symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. But in some people, it can take even longer for symptoms to appear, thus the symptoms can appear anywhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure. Symptoms can include:"
REAL,"â€¢ Fever
â€¢ Cough
â€¢ Trouble breathing â€¢ Feeling tired
â€¢ Muscle aches
Most people have mild symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all. But in other people, COVID-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death."

Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.Â In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to MERS &amp; SARS.
The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID-19."
REAL,"Should I worry about COVID-19? 

Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. 

It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones."
REAL,"Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work."
REAL,"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized."
REAL,"Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19."
REAL,"Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask."
REAL,"Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19."
REAL,"Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics."
REAL,"In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

REAL,"You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water."
REAL,"Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why?"
REAL,"When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why?"
REAL,"Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene."
REAL,"This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why?"
REAL,"Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance."
REAL,"Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility."
REAL,"This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places â€“ especially if you are an older person or have++"

REAL,"Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work."
REAL,"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized."
REAL,"Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19."
REAL,"Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask."
REAL,"Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19."
REAL,"Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics."

REAL,"Everyone hates on the mask, f it mask off then. Jokes aside ot helps with not touching your face and also helps not spreading it if you got it yourself. Or so i have been told"
REAL,"@MooruckTV @MethodScripe It will actually protect you just as he says, by preventing you from touching your face and not getting the virus into your nose/mouth."
REAL,"@MooruckTV @MethodScripe Didn't take the shortage into account. Better to keep your hands clean and spare the masks to those who need it.
Ppl focus too much on the masks and not enough on keeping their hands clean."

REAL,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.

Some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms."
REAL,"Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work."
REAL,"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized."
REAL,"Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19."
REAL,"Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19."
REAL,"Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics."
REAL,"In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

REAL,"How does COVID-19 spread? 

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales."

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work."
REAL,"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized."
REAL,"Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19."
REAL,"Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask."
REAL,"Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19."

Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.

COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks."
REAL,"Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19."
REAL,"You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching covid-19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.

Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms."
REAL,"Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the COVID-19 or any other lung disease.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Take an official test to confirm."

From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials"

Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your body temperature is 36.5Â°C to 37Â°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you"
