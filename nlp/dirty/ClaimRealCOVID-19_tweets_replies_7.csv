Q: So what is herd immunity threshold (HIT) for real pops?
A: *Usually* lower &amp; it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things: 1) contact rates; 2) susceptibility; 3) infectiousness."
REAL,"1) If some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected, lowering HIT. (note: variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread).
2) If some aren't susceptible to infection that reduces HIT. 
3)If some people don't transmit that also reduces HIT."
REAL,Positive correlations among these traits - if individuals w/ more contacts are more susceptible and infectious - can make for very rapid changes in dynamics. Sadly not much empirical data on these correlations &amp; limited data on predictors of variation on susc. &amp; infect.
REAL,"However, see paper by @mgmgomes1 that is even better (b/c more general, better data) than Science paper cited above. Fig shows how variation susc, contacts affects HIT, f, for R0=3; so HIT=0.66, f = 0.94.

REAL,"The take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age (i.e. NOT well-mixed) and w/ arbitrary differential ""activity"" (contact rates) w/in ages can reduce HIT for R0=2.5 from 0.6 to 0.43. https://t.co/z5XPjIET2e"
