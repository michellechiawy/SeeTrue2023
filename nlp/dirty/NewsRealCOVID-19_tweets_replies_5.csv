Charlotte Baker, DrPH, MPH, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine in Blacksburg, Virginia, said your biggest risk at the supermarket is coming into close contact with another person who‚Äôs sick."

REAL,"It‚Äôs not clear, though, how much of a role produce and food packaging plays in transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19.

Some surfaces may pose a bigger risk than others.

REAL,"hours.

Baker said when you‚Äôre at the supermarket, you should ‚Äúassume all surfaces everywhere have been touched by someone who is sick.‚Äù

This includes produce and packaged foods.

‚ÄúTouch just the items you intend to buy, wipe down the cart or basket handles with disinfectant"

REAL,"Next week we see if any of these ""liberate"" protests had an effect."
REAL,"Maybe I should explain myself. If the duration of viral shedding for asymptomatic carriers can be, and often is, more than 14 days, then it doesn‚Äôt matter that the incubation period is less than 14 days: 14-day rules (about quarantining, e.g.) won‚Äôt stop virus transmission."
REAL,"Figures from China suggest 80% of cases are asymptomatic: https://t.co/MX4LMxytrk

REAL,"Data from the diamond princess, one of the first cruise ships to have a widespread outbreak, shows 12 deaths of 712 cases (1.7% mortality). It's well known that cruise ships are especially popular with older age groups, so this mortality rate should theoretically be inflated."
REAL,"The current UK death count is at 12.6 thousand. At a mortality rate of 1.7%, there would be 763,502 total cases. However this doesn't account for the delay between contraction of the virus and death, which can be weeks."
REAL,"The government's scientific advisors have actually suggested that the mortality rate is between 0.5% and 1% (https://t.co/NFedyPqO5K). That would put total UK cases (not accounting for delay) at between 2,573,000 and 1,286,800."
REAL,"At 20,368 cases of covid-19 that will ultimately result in death &amp; mortality between 0.5% &amp; 1%, the total no. of cases would be between 4,073,000 and 2,036,000. I guess we'll find out in a few months time what the real number is."

REAL,@BrendanEich @GregWildSmith @dpinsen There's going to be a significant lag between 'symptoms' and a positive test result for a number of reasons.
REAL,"As the thread notes, China says 2/3 of asymptomatic cases develop symptoms and get reclassified as confirmed cases. But Hubei has reported 303 new such cases but just 2 such patients developing symptoms and become confirmed COVID-19 patients. https://t.co/tCu9FCrOte"
REAL,China started reporting asymptomatic cases on a daily basis since April 1. The fact that there have only been 2 patients so far this month developing symptoms while a total of 303 asymptomatic cases are reported and 852 such patients are released is odd.
REAL,It's not a like for like and it's not clear when those who ended up developed symptoms were first reported as asymptomatic cases. But the very crude calculation for purely illustrative purposes of 57/657 nationally is 8.7% and 2/303 is 0.6%.
REAL,"The fact that there are so few asymptomatic patients reported to have developed symptoms in Hubei and mainland China, in comparison to how many new asymptomatic cases have been reported so far, raises some questions."
REAL,Neither the NHC nor Hubei has provided cumulative statistics on asymptomatic cases found to date or the number of such patients later developing symptoms. So there is a limit to what we can discern from public disclosures.
REAL,"Data published on April 1 by Hubei, for example, the province reported 47 new asymptomatic cases, 1 asymptomatic patient who developed symptoms and 289 asymptomatic patients who were released from medical observation. 982 asymptomatic cases were being monitored at the time."
REAL,"That probably means there were 1,225 under medical observation in Hubei as of March 30. 

From March 31 and April 8, Hubei released 852 asymptomatic patients from observation. Noting again that there were only 2 cases of asymptomatic patients developing symptoms in this window"
REAL,"I am just using official data and have no knowledge of what's happening on the ground. Straightforward reasons could be:

-Patients are being pumped with enough drugs/treatment to keep symptoms from emerging
-It's just taking time for the symptoms to emerge

REAL,"-Incubation period may be longer than 14 days that we generally expect (there have been some cases of this)
-Patients are not being tested correctly or test kits are still not very accurate

REAL,From a fellow Immunology colleague to help understand testing...
REAL,I have borrowed this from a testing kit company website as I thought it is a good explanation of the current testing processes for COVID-19:
REAL,"Laboratory methods for diagnosing COVID-19 follow two pathways - the detection of the coronavirus itself, and the detection of the body's adaptive immune response to the virus.
The stage of COVID-19 disease progression determines which detection method is most effective."
REAL,This antibody rapid test complements nucleic acid methods such as RT-PCR to improve speed of diagnosis and monitor disease progression.
REAL,"As the disease primarily attacks the lungs, specimens taken from the upper respiratory tract may be poor in quality and could lead to false-negatives with PCR."
REAL,"To understand the clinical significance of results obtained from the antibody rapid test, the following information must be considered:"
REAL,"So here's the bit I don't understand.

The average incubation period for the virus is 11.5 days.

#COVID19Children #COVID19Nigeria"
REAL,@ClimateWed A3 Done. #COVID19Children #COVID19Nigeria
REAL,Some children with Covid-19 can still experience serious lung disease.
REAL,Kids with simultaneous respiratory infections can be more vulnerable to Covid-19. Infants without mature immune systems can get sick from the virus.
REAL,That means epidemic control measures ‚Äî from proper hand-washing to social distancing ‚Äî are just as important for the young and healthy as they are for people who are older or sicker.
REAL,"Countries that have experienced more extensive outbreaks of Covid-19, including China and Italy, have seen the worst impacts of Covid-19 on older adults, with the number of people hospitalized and killed by the disease rising with age."
REAL,"Underlying health problems like high blood pressure, a depressed immune system, and diabetes have also worsened the outcomes among the infected."
REAL,"However, a small percentage of younger people, from babies to young adults, have also suffered serious harm."
REAL,"A study published in February in the Journal of the American Medical Association of more than 72,000 infected people in China showed that just 2 percent of the infected in the sample were under the age of 19."
REAL,"Similarly, a February report from the WHO‚Äôs mission to China showed that only 2.4 percent of the infected were 18 years old or younger. Out of those infected young people, 2.5 percent developed severe disease and 0.2 percent developed critical disease."
REAL,"But the WHO report also noted that ‚Äúit is not possible to determine the extent of infection among children, what role children play in transmission, whether children are less susceptible or if they present differently clinically (i.e. generally milder presentations).‚Äù"
REAL,"Which is to say few children are being tested for the virus, so there still isn‚Äôt much good information about how many children are getting infected overall. And from there, it‚Äôs hard to gauge the rate of severe illness for the young."
REAL,"Another element is that Covid-19 seems to play out differently in children compared to what health officials have seen with other infections, such as influenza."
REAL,"Influenza, also caused by a virus that infects the airways, can be a very serious illness in children."
REAL,"Complications from influenza, like a subsequent bacterial pneumonia infection, can be fatal."
REAL,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since September, 144 children have died in the US from influenza in the current season as of March 7."
REAL,"Meanwhile, there have been no reported deaths from Covid-19 among children in the US so far."
REAL,"‚ÄúEverything we know about other viral infections would suggest that children are at higher risk‚Äù of infection, said Bria Coates, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University and an attending physician at the Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children‚Äôs Hospital of Chicago."
REAL,‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt tend to wash their hands very well. They don‚Äôt give each other space.‚Äù Which makes the lower prevalence of severe illness for Covid-19 among children all the more remarkable.
REAL,"The evidence so far suggests that although they are more at risk of contracting the disease, when they do their symptoms, if they have any at all, are milder."
REAL,Which is exactly why the schools in Australia should be closed.
REAL,More tomorrow.
REAL,Trump wants to reopen US businesses in weeks 'not months' even as deaths rise.
REAL,"At tonight‚Äôs White House briefing on coronavirus, Trump officials kept reminding Americans that the president‚Äôs plan to ‚Äústop the spread‚Äù of coronavirus was only a ‚Äú15 day challenge‚Äù and they were already halfway through."
REAL,"Well I hope Covid-19 cooperates with him, but I don‚Äôt think it is listening."
REAL,"He has already done enormous damage that the global effort against this virus, and is showing no leadership on the issue in the US."
REAL,"I may talk about that tomorrow,"
REAL,"Scott Morrison‚Äôs office called the ABC‚Äôs news boss, Gaven Morris, last week suggesting Swan should speak to Murphy.

Sources say the prime minister‚Äôs office was concerned Swan‚Äôs advice was contrary to that of Murphy‚Äôs."
REAL,"‚ÄúTest a lot, isolate, find all contacts if you can and isolate them,‚Äù Swan, who trained as a medical practitioner, said on social media early last week. ‚ÄúStop mass mingling. Bring the public with you."
REAL,Young people as well as the elderly will die unnecessarily if we don‚Äôt act. Today‚Äôs cases are the result of what we didn‚Äôt do two weeks ago.‚Äù
REAL,Swan is right the government is wrong.
REAL,The government‚Äôs handling of this crisis has been more about politics and less about good medical practice.
REAL,"‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs almost a math problem in some ways, right?‚Äù says Benjamin Singer, an assistant professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine."
REAL,"‚ÄúEven with a lower likelihood of younger people getting critically ill, a certain percentage will get critically ill, and since the denominator is growing and growing these cases are popping up more and more.‚Äù"
REAL,Underlying health conditions can also make younger people susceptible to a severe case of the virus.
REAL,"In China smoking seemed prominent in this respect, but the presence of chronic disease also makes young people more vulnerable in the young as in the old."
REAL,"Where you find severe cases or even death in young people, we don‚Äôt really have full information on these patients,‚Äù says Lee Riley, chair of the division of infectious disease and vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley."
REAL,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible that some of those people might have had medical conditions that we just didn‚Äôt know about.
REAL,"Even younger people who feel perfectly healthy need to take the pandemic seriously because they can spread the virus even if they‚Äôre not feeling any symptoms, Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said."
REAL,"‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get the attitude, ‚ÄòWell, I‚Äôm young, I‚Äôm invulnerable,‚Äô‚Äù"
REAL,"Fauci said at a press briefing  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to put your loved ones at risk, particularly the ones who are elderly and the ones who have compromised conditions. We can‚Äôt do this without the young people cooperating. Please cooperate with us.‚Äù"
REAL,"Kids can spread the virus to more vulnerable adults, and infants may have a higher risk of serious illness than older children."
REAL,This age disparity of severe cases has become a critical question as scientists race to slow the virus‚Äôs spread.
REAL,"Some clues to this mystery are starting to emerge, and the answers could help establish what kinds of infection control measures are actually effective, as well as point the way toward treatments."

REAL,Remdesivir has emerged as leading candidate in the short term treatment of covid-19. It works by inhibiting RNA replicase to stop covid from replicating the virus. Gilead currently uses for HIV - gov‚Äôt going to take steps to facilitate large-scale manufacturing by other companies
REAL,They're testing higher doses than previously used - they think dosage of 200mg followed by 100mg for 5 - 10 days is not enough. However side effects from higher dosage are a concern. Goal is an inhaled form of remdesivir so treatment can be administered remotely and more widely.
REAL,remdesivir is unlikely to be more effective for treating COVID-19 than the best monoclonal antibodies currently under development. But they won't be available for a few more months at the earliest. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Vir Biotechnology are currently leading this space.
REAL,"This approach has the potential to be in human clinical trials by June, and if expedited with assistance from the government, to be approved by this summer or fall.  But there must be regulatory flexibility and focused efforts to eliminate all avoidable bottlenecks."
REAL,Trials usually begin with a safety trial in a small number of people. Suggestion for monoclonal antibody treatments be allowed to proceed directly to a larger trial. A review of an NDA normally takes 9-12 months recommendation is to complete the review within 1 week of receipt!
REAL,broad administration can begin both as a treatment (prioritizing critically ill patients) and as a short-term vaccine immediately upon FDA approval. Desired timeframe: August-September 2020. but we'll need a vaccine-based approach to establish long-term victory over the virus.
REAL,"average time for new vaccine development and approval is six - eight years. Approaches being pursued - inactivated virus particles (Sinovac), recombinant proteins (Sanofi), live hybrid viruses (Janssen), and RNA-based vaccines (Moderna, CureVac, BioNTech/Pfizer, Translate/Sanofi)"
REAL,"At present, the non-company funding sources for the majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efforts include the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the U.S. government (BARDA), the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)"

REAL,"3) Data that shook the world - Modelling the COVID-19 pandemic and the Impact of NPIs to reduce COVID-19 mortality &amp; healthcare demand. 

This section summarises how infectious disease models work, &amp; how they are used to predict &amp; develop effective strategies to combat diseases."
REAL,"Most epidemic models are based on SIR (susceptible, infected, and dead/removed) models. The primary inputs of these models are the SIR numbers, R (the reproduction number of the virus eg., how many people one person infects on average), and the incubation period of the disease."
REAL,"Other important inputs are the mortality rate, hospitalisation rate, healthcare capacity, population demographics, methods of disease transmission, &amp; implementation of NPIs. I will now refer to some of the main models which have impacted UK (&amp; global) policy in response to COVID."
REAL,"First, I think it is important to give some context. As COVID-19 is a novel disease with, at the time, little known about it, early modelling was very difficult to get accurate. Most models were based off a 2006 model from the paper 'Strategies for pandemic influenza mitigation.‚Äô"
REAL,"For context, the 2006 influenza pandemic paper has several interesting findings, predicting case isolation/household quarantine would have the most significant impact, school closures could reduce peak attack rates by 40%, and travel bans would have little overall effect.
14/ https://t.co/S7MRTrMiD6"
REAL,"When @neilferguson published the model on the predicted deaths from COVID-19 and the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 mortality, it was an urgent call to switch strategies from mitigation to suppression, countering his own earlier paper on strategies during an influenza pandemic.
15/"
REAL,"Soon after, both the UK and the US government (and more) effectively changed strategy from mitigation to one of suppression, initiating 'lockdown.' This makes the @imperialcollege paper one of the most influential of all time, &amp; so is worth taking the time to read and understand."
REAL,"The model predicted that if countries continued with mitigation, there would be over 500,000 deaths in the UK from COVID-19, millions hospitalised, and a peak healthcare demand at 8 - 30 times surge capacity. 
17/

https://t.co/x4wmRU3KHY https://t.co/3jVE2JS7XO"
REAL,"To reduce mortality &amp; stress on healthcare systems, whilst also minimising the total period of lockdown, the model recommends cycling periods of mitigation &amp; suppression (for up to 18 months!), controlled by regionalised capacity 'trigger points.‚Äô
18/ https://t.co/A5ypJ4QzdE"
REAL,"Even with these NPIs in place, COVID-19 deaths still approach 50,000, and the healthcare system will be extremely stressed over a protracted period &amp; likely take years to recover, but will not be overwhelmed. Authors acknowledge the long-term feasibility of some of these measures https://t.co/uoIdYiXUQU"
REAL,"With some criticism that the model is not peer-reviewed &amp; too bleak in its outlook, some revisions have been made to reflect a higher(!) R number, increased healthcare capacity &amp; to reflect the NPIs that the UK has taken, although this hasn't affected the main conclusions by much"
REAL,"A @cmmid_lshtm model also agreed with the switch from mitigation to suppression, concluding mitigation wouldn't have reduced R sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding NHS availability &amp; that more extreme restrictions were necessary to keep ICU demand below capacity.

https://t.co/HXilKryVet"
REAL,"As the situation develops, and things such as more accurate data, antiviral drugs, and increased healthcare and contact tracing capacities come into play, these models will be updated, and the strategy may then be able to return to one of mitigation until a vaccine arrives."
REAL,"It is also worth noting that that @neil_ferguson of @imperialcollege will be releasing their model on strategies to lift the lockdown in the next few days. But, models are only simulations of the real world, and have many limitations..."

3. Pets are great company."

5. The real issue isn't getting motivated to start, it's being disciplined enough to stop. Only work in one room and at a designated time, stop, close the door and do other stuff."
REAL,"6. At least once a day, phone someone for a chat. You know, like in olden times.

7. When the tea and coffee runs out, things turn nasty. Online supermarket deliveries rule.

8. Try and eat something different each day for lunch and don't have it in the room you work in."

REAL,"4. Depend on God for protection 

Show your dependence on God by regularly praying to Him. Prayer is one way of showing our dependence on God.

REAL,"for His children. If you believe it, you will experience it.

Psalm 125:1-2 NKJV
Those who trust in the LORD Are like Mount Zion, Which cannot be moved, but abides forever. 
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the LORD surrounds His people From this time forth and forever."
REAL,"Psalm 7:10 NKJV
[10] My defense is of God, Who saves the upright in heart.

5. Replace your fear with faith in God

Fear attracts the devil while faith attracts God. God goes to work wherever He sees faith while the devil goes to work wherever he sees fear."
REAL,"If you want God to work in your favor, then say no to fear. Feed your faith with the Word of God. If you keep your faith alive, it will keep you alive.

2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV
[7] For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.

Ephesians 6:16"
REAL,"[16] above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.

James 4:7 NKJV
[7] Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you."
REAL,"Resist the devil by submitting to God.
Resist him by standing on the promises of God.
Resist him by proclaiming the word of God.
Resist him by confessing and declaring the promises of God.
Resist him by living right and standing for what is right."
REAL,"Resist him by declaring that Lordship of Jesus over all.
Sooner or later he will flee.

7. Don‚Äôt be quite

Death and life are in the power of the tongue. Your confession determines your possession. What you say is what you get. To receive life, you must release life."
REAL,"It is alright to be calm in the midst of a storm But you cannot afford to be quiet because so much depends on your confession. A closed mouth is a closed destiny. 

There is power in faith confession. There is so much power in the words we speak. So don‚Äôt be quite."
REAL,"Keep declaring the word of God over your life and your family and you shall live to testify of victory over Corona virus, when the storm is over. Jesus Christ remains Lord

God bless you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
REAL,"Faith comes by hearing, fear does also. What you hear will either feed your faith or fuel your fear. So be careful what you believe. Get the facts.

Romans 10:17 NKJV

REAL,"*What is the origin of COVID-19?
According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of a seafood market might explain its outbreak, thus representing a clear example as to why food control is important. This conclusion is by no means restricted to China [1]."
REAL,"*How is COVID-19 transmitted?
Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. Furthermore, there is no evidence that an infected mom might transmit it to her child [2]."
REAL,"*What are its symptoms?
The most common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 illness are fever, cough, and fatigue, while other symptoms include sputum production, headache, shortness of breath, diarrhea, blood expectoration, and reduced level of lymphocytes [2]."
REAL,"*How fast does COVID-19 affect its victims?
The symptoms of infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 5.2 days. The period from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days (median of 14 days) [2]."
REAL,"*Which population is the most vulnerable?
This period of incubation is dependent on the age of the patient and the status of the patient's immune system. It is shorter among patients &gt;70-years old compared with those under that age [2]."
REAL,"*Is there any treatment available yet?
There are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 yet, and it is unlikely to find a treatment for at least another 12‚Äì18 months, even though huge funding has been committed and there are four candidates in development [3]."
REAL,"*Is there a way to prevent its spread?
Various bodies including the WHO and US CDC have issued advice on preventing further spread of COVID-19. They recommend avoiding travel to high-risk areas, and the consumption of meat from regions with known COVID-19 outbreak [4]."
REAL,"Basic hand hygiene measures are also recommended, including frequent hand washing and the use of face masks. Japanese-based company Bespoke Inc has also launched an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot (Bebot) that provides up to date information regarding the coronavirus [4]."
REAL,"*Are children immune to Covid-19?
Experts suggest that children are most likely asymptomatic (not immune), thus producing a reduced incidence rate in this population as they have not been extensively tested yet [5]."
REAL,"**Do pets represent a source of infection?
There is no evidence that pets can spread COVID-19 or that they might be a source of infection. However, because all animals can carry germs, it‚Äôs always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals [6]."

REAL,"@Yamiche No masks, no problem. No burgers for the president, let's use the power of the federal govt. to address the problem."
REAL,"@Yamiche But the post office, not critical infrastructure. Because  meat-processing plants are in the constitution."
REAL,"@Yamiche Critical infrastructure = toilet paper, PPE and wine.  Meat easily replaceable w plant-based foods."
REAL,@Yamiche Mmmm. You know we know they aren't going to get the PPE needed or testing. He signs that everything that happens at meat plant post signature us 100% his responsibility. Oooh. I can't today. I have  een able to up til now. I CANNOT 2day!
REAL,@Yamiche Are the workers 'critical' or just the meat?!
REAL,@Yamiche He's gotta make sure he can get his cheeseburgers
REAL,@Yamiche This is a nightmare situation.  Has he ever been in a meat plant?  Trump better pull out all the stops on testing for all. #TestingTestingTesting
REAL,@Yamiche Outrageous!!
REAL,"@Yamiche This will probably change tomorrow because reopening requires testing due to Covid 19 outbreaks in these food production lines. So, around and around we go. https://t.co/LbhiEqCN66"

REAL,@Yamiche Maybe he should send his sons to work at the plants since most of the employees have Covid.
REAL,@Yamiche He wants them EXEMPT FROM LIABILITY.
REAL,@Yamiche What about his administration's disruption of PPE and other medical supplies they highjack?
REAL,@Yamiche He is worried of not getting his Big Macs
REAL,@Yamiche I just switched to buying meat from the local organic butcher. I will buy less meat because it costs more but I won't have to worry about my meat being infected with #C19
REAL,"@Yamiche The USDA has not been able to keep their own employees safe in these large, mostly foreign-owned, meat processing facilities.

Over 100 USDA Inspectors are confirmed to have COVID-19. At least two have died.

Be safe.
Buy small.
Buy local."
REAL,@Yamiche A worthy story Yamiche. Good for you.
REAL,@Yamiche How does he intend to make dead people process the meat?
REAL,@Yamiche He uses it to save the economy...but wont budge when it comes to saving lives and making tests....pathetic.

REAL,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered Coronavirus.
The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. #BreakingTheChain,@YaliBauchi @NCDCgov"
REAL,"Virology
Corona is a latin word meaning ‚Äúcrown‚Äù
Spherical or pleomorphic enveloped particles containing single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. The envelope bears club-shaped glycoprotein projections."

Coronaviruses (and toroviruses) are classified together on the basis of the crown or halo-like appearance of the envelope glycoproteins, and on characteristic features of chemistry and replication. #BreakingTheChain, @YaliBauchi @NCDCgov @SenBalaMohammed"

REAL,"... this is an area of R&amp;D I've been involved with for decades, and I'm well aware that how respirators etc. work isn't intuitive, and that simply because something looks like a face mask, doesn't mean it'll work like on! ...(3/n)"
REAL,"... to fill this gap the video is a really basic primer on the science of how respirators and face masks capture particles, what causes them to fail, and how to design them well. Here's the link again: https://t.co/tAlnex8UkC (4/n)"

REAL,Nurse family member has been instructed by supervisors that they are allowed one mask per week unless it's damaged. They only get an N95 mask when in contact with a known positive COVID-19 patient. She's not on front lines (yet) so they're rationing PPE to those on the back end.
REAL,"She's on day 5 of her 3 day shift. She asked how many masks a day niecechild can make so she can have extra and some to share. I went to Joann Fabric to get materials, and I'm not sure if this is public info but they're giving away pre-made bags of supplies and instructions."

REAL,Many doctors have been expressly told by their administration not to speak publicly about conditions. And few will go against their employer out of fear of being fired. That means the stories about PPE shortages likely underestimate the problem.
REAL,"Adding to the shortages of PPE and the muzzling of frontline clinicians is the lack of testing. We simply don't know who is infected. And if you don't know that, you don't know who to isolate."
REAL,"we would use masks and PPE routinely, and we would test patients immediately so that those infected can be put in isolation, on home quarantine .These seemingly simple actions would protect caregivers. But we can't do that because we don't have access to rapid testing or PPE."

REAL,Time for our first üüß day briefing from Angela Dunn. Follow along here or you can stream it at https://t.co/GhHRg65gXB. #utpol
REAL,First running down the numbers. Emphasizes the importance to protect high-risk populations. She says the state has deployed a strike team to a facility in Utah Co that cares for people with disabilities. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre approaching this with a sense of urgency.‚Äù #utpol
REAL,Dunn praises state‚Äôs ability to test anyone with mild symptoms. Working on contact tracing. She says there is evidence of pre-symptomatic spread ‚Äî¬†which is why there is a need to socially distance and wear masks when not possible. #utpol
REAL,"What advice does she have for people in rural parts of the state that haven‚Äôt been as impacted?

Normal principles of social distancing still hold. Those in vulnerable populations should continue being extremely cautious. #utpol"
REAL,"Winslow asks what is expected later this year. Dunn says no models are perfect, but we are anticipating a resurgence of COVID later in the year.
 
‚ÄúI think the challenging piece will be that social distancing, will we need additional social distancing restrictions.‚Äù #utpol"
REAL,"Q about TestUtah and if Health Dept is monitoring how they conduct tests. 

Dunn says department has worked with TestUtah since the beginning on who to test. Have strengthened the process so anyone tested anywhere has the same experience. #utpol"
REAL,"Dunn: With a second wave in the fall, this will be ‚Äútop of our minds‚Äù until we get a vaccine, so at least another year. 

Dunn says she is working with hospitals to get the number of those currently hospitalized and hopes to have them next week. #utpol"
REAL,"The challenge, she said, has been hospitals are reporting them differently. 

Dunn said the UTCo facility is a residential facility that serves intellectually disabled adults and doesn‚Äôt normally have nursing care. So state is providing nursing care, providing PPE. #utpol"
REAL,"At that facility, 15 residents and nine staff have tested positive, Dunn says. 

The strike team will have caregivers and testing capacity.

And that‚Äôs the end. Be careful out there. #utpol https://t.co/yHyt5pbJbn"

REAL,En la Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) han realizado un estudio sobre el efecto del uso de mascarillas en TODA la comunidad para controlar la enfermedad por COVID-19.

REAL,"Ellos hab√≠an sufrido el SARS en 2003 y la gripe pand√©mica H1N1 en 2009, por lo tanto conoc√≠an las medidas de cierre de fronteras, cuarentena, test, rastreo de contactos y lavado de manos frecuente."
REAL,"Adem√°s de medidas de distanciamiento social, como el cierre de escuelas, trabajo en casa y cese de actividad econ√≥mica."
REAL,"Debido a esta experiencia, tras el anuncio oficial de un grupo de pacientes con neumon√≠a en Wuhan el 31 de diciembre de 2020 y la identificaci√≥n del SARS-CoV-2 el 12 de febrero de 2020, la poblaci√≥n estaba en alerta m√°xima."
REAL,"Aunque inicialmente el gobierno de HKSAR solo hizo la recomendaci√≥n de uso de mascarilla quir√∫rgica a personas con s√≠ntomas respiratorios, la poblaci√≥n US√ì MASCARILLAS VOLUNTARIAMENTE üò∑ desde la fase previa a la pandemia de COVID-19."
REAL,"Pero hay un detalle importante, no se hab√≠a investigado la eficacia üìàüìâde usar o no mascarilla en TODA la poblaci√≥n durante las epidemias pasadas y la actual COVID-19."
REAL,"Existe una diferencia notable entre el SARS 2003 que presenta fiebre alta y neumon√≠a progresiva, y COVID-19 que se asocia con s√≠ntomas muy leves."
REAL,"Entonces, los TRANSMISORES ASINTOM√ÅTICOS representan un papel muy importante para FRENAR al virus. ‚õîÔ∏è"
REAL,Para evaluar y controlar la propagaci√≥n del COVID-19 en HKSAR hicieron este estudio.
REAL,67 trabajadores (9 Unidad de Control de Infecciones y 58 del Departamento de Microbiolog√≠a) residentes en 18 distritos de HKSAR se dedicaron a contar qui√©n llevaba mascarilla y qui√©n no entre las primeras 50 personas que se encontrar√°n en su trayecto hacia al hospital Queen Mary.
REAL,"Durante tres d√≠as consecutivos, del 6 al 8 de abril de 2020, se observaron a 10.050 personas y solo 337 no llevaban mascarilla."
REAL,"El 97% de la poblaci√≥n LLEVABA MASCARILLA de forma VOLUNTARIA, ignorando las recomendaciones de la OMS de usar mascarilla solo las personas con s√≠ntomas respiratorios."
REAL,"En HKSAR, hasta el d√≠a 100 de la epidemia se diagnosticaron 961 pacientes. La incidencia de COVID-19 en HKSAR (129.0 por mill√≥n de habitantes) fue significativamente menor que la de Espa√±a (2983.2), Italia (2250.8) o Alemania (1241.5)."
REAL,"En el estudio se comparan los casos positivos en entornos recreativos donde las personas no usaban mascarilla (ir a un restaurante, ir a un karaoke) y casos positivos en entornos de trabajo donde si se llevaba puesta la mascarilla."
REAL,"Como conclusi√≥n y ante los hallazgos de que puede haber muchas personas ASINTOM√ÅTICAS, el uso de mascarillas en TODA la poblaci√≥n puede contribuir al control de COVID-19."

REAL,There are several reasons for the budget troubles. States - which have to balance their budgets - had to make tough decisions after the Great Recession.

REAL,The @APHL - which represents public health labs - says the boom and bust funding makes it hard for lab directors to manage a budget and retain staff.

REAL,"Half the states &amp; Washington D.C. cut public health funding between '08 and '18, according to data from @SHADAC. How do those cuts translate to workers? Adriane Casalotti with @NACCHOalerts said 23% of the local public health workforce, 56,000 people, were cut over that time."

A thread on #CrudeOil 

A brief explaination of WTI and Brent crude"
REAL,"Oil markets witnessed a historic moment on Monday when WTI crude for May delivery fell more than 100 percent, settling at around -$37/bbl indicating that producers would have to pay traders to take oil off them."
REAL,"WTI is extracted from oil fields in the United States. It is primarily extracted in Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota and is then transported via pipeline to Cushing, Oklahoma for delivery. Cushing was a major spot for oil for decades, and has been the delivery spot for contracts"
REAL,"Brent crude is extracted from oil fields in the North Sea. ‚ÄòBrent Crude‚Äô refers to a blend of four crude oils - Brent, Forties, Osberg, and Ekofisk which together are known as BFOE. It contains 0.37% of sulfur. Brent futures contracts are traded on the Intercontinental Exchange"
REAL,"Why did WTI futures fall so much?

Just like any other commodities, WTI has future contracts expiring every month. For WTI, the current month expiry was on April 21. Also, remember these contracts have to be settled physically."
REAL,"This means the buyer of a futures contract will have to take delivery of physical crude, if he is still holding the contract at expiry. This delivery is to be taken at Cushing. There are also speculators who have not contracted for storage of the incoming crude."
REAL,"However, considering the times we are in, there were no buyers for this contract due to sharp fall in oil demand in the US and also globally. Refiners do not have enough capacity to the store the crude, airlines and transport is shut."
REAL,"Why does Brent not fall so much?
Brent futures expire on April 30. The sell off seen in WTI is not happening in Brent simply because Brent crude contracts settle in cash. Thus, any speculator can take them to their expiry without being forced to sell at any price unlike WTI"
REAL,"Another reason is that Brent Brent essentially draws its oil from more than a dozen oil fields located in the North Sea. It is close to water and hence can be stored in tankers, while WTI, because of its landlocked nature, is quite far from the nearest water body."
REAL,"Why is Brent preferred over WTI?

WTI usually trades at discount to brent. WTI is the benchmark for oil prices in the US, while the rest of the world - and nearly two-thirds of all oil contracts traded - are on Brent. This makes Brent the global benchmark."
REAL,"@deepvaluepubs Maybe it depends on amounts. If the contracts they held were for vastly larger storage amounts they thought wasn't worth to do it piecemeal (I'm just thinking out loud).

What other possibilities you think could explain why drop into negati"

REAL,"Oil prices, and hence gas prices are at pennies. But the price per gallon at the pump has not dropped. I do not understand."
REAL,"@cyrusnelson It wasn't reported it was futures, and here, the price has dropped, but then it has stayed the same at around $2.29. if you have a membership card to some business, it's a little cheaper."
REAL,We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know ‚Äî and we‚Äôre experiencing right now! ‚Äî the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods.
REAL,"I‚Äôm with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take care of people we don‚Äôt know ‚Äî all of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served."
REAL,"Is the problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldn‚Äôt have the homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers and smartphones, that we already have."
REAL,The problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is inertia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things. The problem is regulatory capture.
REAL,"We need to want new companies to build these things, even if incumbents don‚Äôt like it, even if only to force the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is will. We need to build these things."
REAL,"And we need to separate the imperative to build these things from ideology and politics. Both sides need to contribute to building. The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place."
REAL,"The right is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that hold back market-based competition and the building of things."
REAL,"The right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly) innovation."
REAL,"It‚Äôs time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward."
REAL,"The left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that the public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing."
REAL,"Stop trying to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future. Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results."
REAL,"Instead of taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge ‚Äî build new things and show the results! Show that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and effective ‚Äî how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes along, blow us away!"
REAL,"Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with public funding; why can‚Äôt 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldn‚Äôt regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build?"
REAL,"Solve the climate crisis by building ‚Äî energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so let‚Äôs build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?"
REAL,"In fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The things we build in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly in price. The things we don‚Äôt, like housing, schools, and hospitals, skyrocket in price"
REAL,"What‚Äôs the American dream? The opportunity to have a home of your own, &amp; a family you can provide for. We need to break the rapidly escalating price curves for üè†ing, education, &amp; healthcare, to make sure that every üá∫üá∏'an  realize the dream, &amp; the only way to do that is to build."
REAL,"Building isn‚Äôt easy, or we‚Äôd already be doing all this. We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society. And we need to demand more from one another."
REAL,"We‚Äôre all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building. Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building?"
REAL,"What are you building directly, or helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of people who are building?"
REAL,"If the work you‚Äôre doing isn‚Äôt either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, we‚Äôve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building."
REAL,"There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems ‚Äî we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems."
REAL,"I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here‚Äôs a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There‚Äôs an excellent chance I‚Äôll agree with you."
REAL,"Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building."

REAL,"When we talk about oil prices, we're generally not talking about people buying and selling and transporting physical barrels of oil. We're talking about futures contracts -- a promise of oil to be delivered at certain dates in the future."
REAL,"As the world produces more oil than it needs, storage facilities have been filling up. https://t.co/xrv6TVzeTm"

REAL,"Q: Is now a good time to #invest?

Jackson says that now is a great time to invest, saying that ""the future is in our control."" The companies that won't survive are the ones who have just shut down and haven't sought out viable solutions, she adds."
REAL,"The same way we found ways to work during the #pandemic, we need to keep that level of agility in business, Jackson says, adding that providing insight and analyses in a digital format will be key."
REAL,"Smith jumps in, agreeing with Jackson's views and suggesting that now is a good time to seek out value in the stock market.

Embracing new #technologies and making sure that the company is harmonized digitally, and easing client-customer communication, will be essential, he adds."
REAL,"""We need to think about when everything's back to normal, whatever you're selling, there has to be two options,"" Jackson says, citing a client she has who initially shut her storefront business, then reopened a delivery service and saw her sales rise dramatically."
REAL,"Jackson's business has always been a bit 'feast or famine,' and the way that a company behaves during the lean times will define them, she says. Paying attention to trends and the up-and-downs is key."
REAL,"Smith joins in, noting that even though the tech market has received a demand boost off #coronavirus, there's still set to be some contraction, and what consumers need from these businesses has changed - and will continue to change."
REAL,"Holding your nerve and continuing to invest in innovation will be essential to survival, customer happiness and optimisation, he adds."
REAL,"In difficult times like this, being able to show clients how valuable you are is critical, Jackson says. As engagement has skyrocketed between video calls and emails, organisations have less time, and need to invest in their business - in her case, in #talent recruitment."
REAL,"Q: The idea that innovation isn't going to slow down - do you think clients are looking for more updates, reviewing systems, or will there be a drive towards new products and services?"
REAL,"Smith says it'll likely be a mix of things, adding that organisations who are responding, refocusing and looking at their place in the market critically will be ahead of the game."
REAL,"Jackson adds that it's quite difficult to go back to 'normal,' and that people will likely resist digitalisation over job concerns. She's seen the #legal sector change as they resist tech like smart contracts, and suggests that change should be driven forward for the better."
REAL,"Q: With so many unknowns, how can you manage expectations and projections?

Smith says that rolling forecasts and scenario planning/analysis are important for organisations to get on top of, and that they should look at both optimistic and pessimistic forecasting."
REAL,"This is the time to have scenario planning, Jackson chimes in, suggesting that this is the time to bin year-long budgets and look at things in the shorter term. Having a ""start-up mentality"" and looking closely at projections and forecasts will be useful."
REAL,"Q: We're arguably in a false #economy, with all the government support. What's your reaction to the UK government's intervention?

Smith says the measures, from the financial perspective, were announced quickly, but there are still challenges for fledgling businesses."
REAL,"Jackson concurs, saying the speed of the government's economic action has been better than other countries' work. She says that while it did help calm the nation and support the business ecosystem, they should now move to looking at projections and repayment."
REAL,"Q: Does it seem like regulators will be sympathetic to the current situation?

Smith says it's hard to say and it will depend on industry. There's a pragmatic approach by all regulators in terms of not making things overly onerous in extraordinary times, he says."
REAL,"Moving on to audience questions, McCaw asks Smith how to risk manage quickly and assess new suppliers.

Smith says onboarding isn't always a quick process, but customers come first and sourcing can take some innovation. Cutting through processes and being pragmatic is useful."
REAL,"Jackson says that cash is king, and while her cost base has always been quite low, they're focused on income, costs and managing that overall #cashflow."
REAL,"Q: Within your industry, do you think costs will be pushed down across the board?

Jackson says that she's had to consider things in a far different light, and that people are challenging everything along that #costbase. She suggests that everyone will have to become more agile."
REAL,"How have you seen client's talent needs change?

Jackson says companies are seeking out analytical talent and recommends that anyone with job insecurity take advantage of free, online courses to hone soft, technical and management skills."
REAL,"That brings us to the end of our Live Discussion, and we'd like to give another thank you to Robert Smith and Yemi Jackson for joining us today.

REAL,"Today I want to talk about contract tracing, which is one of the most critical tools we have to reduce our spread rate, speed up our diagnoses and seek to halt outbreaks before they happen."
REAL,"Let‚Äôs start with the basics: What is contract tracing? 

It's a system to make sure you get notified if you had contact with someone who has tested positive for #COVID19 ‚Äì so you can do what‚Äôs necessary to keep you, your family and your community safe."
REAL,"In order to move safely back toward normalcy, Illinois, the United States, and frankly the whole world must contract trace on a never-before-seen scale.

This is an unprecedented public health challenge ‚Äì so we need an unprecedented solution to meet the moment."
REAL,"To do that, Illinois will be building on our existing infrastructure and expertise to shape a massive statewide contact tracing operation ‚Äì gradually building over the coming weeks, and then scaling up an army of contact tracers by the hundreds and then thousands."
REAL,"Based on our current rates of spread, we‚Äôre looking at a benchmark that could approach 30 workers per 100,000 residents ‚Äì but to be clear, that number can and will diminish if we see greater success in our public health measures, like our face-covering requirement."
REAL,"Already, we‚Äôve identified groups of Illinois residents to quickly scale up our efforts: undergraduate and graduate students, volunteers, retired health professionals, local health officials, community health workers and new hires. All of them are heroes."
REAL,"When someone tests positive for COVID-19, a contract tracer will reach out to them through an app, email, text or phone call. 

Because not everybody can or will use this technology, some will require follow up with a safe in-person visit if you can‚Äôt be reached in another way."
REAL,"In step 2: we'll interview the COVID-positive person, asking them to gather their contacts &amp; retrace their steps over the past 14 days. 

We'll then notify the contacts that they've been in proximity to a positive case, recommend testing &amp; self-isolation, and offer resources."
REAL,"Privacy is an important aspect of maintaining trust in contact tracing, so to be clear, contacts will remain anonymous."
REAL,"Remember, we aren‚Äôt reinventing the wheel here.

Contact tracing has been done in every pandemic and major outbreak for many years. 

Our efforts will lead to an all-around healthier Illinois."

REAL,"Suppose the following were true.
1) I thought I'd had too many cases to eradicate by preventing almost any spread, Korea or NZ-style, but I did still want to eradicate rather than achieve herd immunity.+"
REAL,"2) Next, suppose I did some behavioural analysis &amp; decided people would modify their behaviour a lot for a short time &amp; a bit for a longer time. And suppose my models said that ""a bit"" would take the R0 down to some number - let's say 1.5."
REAL,"With these two assumptions in place, the following strategy might be implementable.
We allow sufficient spread that after the period where we have strong containment, the R0 of the longer-sustained modified behaviour means the herd immunity threshold lies below the % infected.+"
REAL,"Then we encourage society to maintain the modified behaviour for long enough (and it may not take that long) that the disease can then be eradicated via case isolation etc, NZ-style.+"
REAL,"What am I saying. Let's put it crudely. Suppose the herd immunity threshold were 60%. I could wait until 10% were infected, then lock down until 25% had been infected. Then if I could keep the R0 to 1.2, R would be below 1 (given we'd be above herd immunity) &amp; it wld die out."
REAL,"With those numbers it sounds hard, but suppose I got lucky &amp; it turned out a further 20% of the population were immune for some reason. Then I have 45% immune. So if my behaviour-modified R0 is below 1.8 I'll achieve eradication if I can keep it up.+"

REAL,"I know these past two months have probably felt like a crash course in new terminology and techniques, but each of these components is vital to our efforts to reduce social restrictions, get our economy going and protect our residents."
REAL,"Today I want to talk about contract tracing, which is one of the most critical tools we have to reduce our spread rate, speed up our diagnoses and seek to halt outbreaks before they happen."
REAL,"Let‚Äôs start with the basics: What is contract tracing? 

It's a system to make sure you get notified if you had contact with someone who has tested positive for #COVID19 ‚Äì so you can do what‚Äôs necessary to keep you, your family and your community safe."
REAL,"In order to move safely back toward normalcy, Illinois, the United States, and frankly the whole world must contract trace on a never-before-seen scale.

This is an unprecedented public health challenge ‚Äì so we need an unprecedented solution to meet the moment."
REAL,"To do that, Illinois will be building on our existing infrastructure and expertise to shape a massive statewide contact tracing operation ‚Äì gradually building over the coming weeks, and then scaling up an army of contact tracers by the hundreds and then thousands."
REAL,"Based on our current rates of spread, we‚Äôre looking at a benchmark that could approach 30 workers per 100,000 residents ‚Äì but to be clear, that number can and will diminish if we see greater success in our public health measures, like our face-covering requirement."
REAL,"Already, we‚Äôve identified groups of Illinois residents to quickly scale up our efforts: undergraduate and graduate students, volunteers, retired health professionals, local health officials, community health workers and new hires. All of them are heroes."
REAL,"When someone tests positive for COVID-19, a contract tracer will reach out to them through an app, email, text or phone call. 

Because not everybody can or will use this technology, some will require follow up with a safe in-person visit if you can‚Äôt be reached in another way."
REAL,"In step 2: we'll interview the COVID-positive person, asking them to gather their contacts &amp; retrace their steps over the past 14 days. 

We'll then notify the contacts that they've been in proximity to a positive case, recommend testing &amp; self-isolation, and offer resources."
REAL,"Privacy is an important aspect of maintaining trust in contact tracing, so to be clear, contacts will remain anonymous."
REAL,"So serious question someone posed to me that I have no answer for: If there is a substantial asymptomatic or marginally symptomatic population, how are we supposed to test and trace effectively?"

REAL,3. I have fucked up so many times. I don‚Äôt understand how my son is still alive.
REAL,4. My son actively tries to kill himself on a daily basis. My goal is to prevent that and he makes it incredibly hard.
REAL,5. Seeing him develop is one of the greatest experiences I didn‚Äôt think I would love. How much he is loves learning new concepts is such a joy.
REAL,6. Parenting is very hard but it also brings so much joy. Seeing your little replica crawling around and screaming for joy makes everything bad in life seem okay.

REAL,"The same thing goes for buying a home. Even if it's not making money while you are living in it, the hope is that the value will increase over time.

It is an investment in your future and your family's future.
Ownership is the cornerstone of wealth creation.

REAL,"Is it possible that you could buy a home and it not appreciate in value? Yep it is possible. 

But what's the alternative?? Paying someone rent for years with NO POSSIBILITY of everrrrr getting a return on that money?

*I'll take home ownership for 100 Alex.*

REAL,"Even if you buy a house &amp; somehow you don't make any money off of it- What if you were able to leave it to your kids or neices/nephews &amp; they were able to have a roof over their heads &amp; all they have to pay is property taxes. That would put them so far ahead of the game!
---&gt;"
REAL,"ALSO- I know plenty of investors who used the equity from their primary residence to buy their first rental property and that catapulted them to be in a position to build real estate empires- all because they owned the home they live in and were able to leverage that value.

1. Don't downplay the decision that others have made to become home owners.

2. Just own SOMETHING.

REAL,"Thread re. recent paper led by @DettePretorius:

Big survey (n=1308) of 18-25 year olds on help-seeking scenarios. Results informed creation of 3 groupings to illustrate online help-seeking behaviours:

1) Information-seeker
2) Person-centred
3) Crisis-situation"
REAL,"2) Person-centred: goes online to gain a sense of relatedness with others through a variety of means - i.e., personal stories/vlogs.  &lt;--(not escapism or avoidance)

3) Crisis-situation: immediate need for on/offline help to address in-situ distress."
REAL,"These 3 groupings were then used to make 'personas' from which co-design workshops with 35 young people occurred. 

So what did young people say about these personas and how would they then design appropriate technologies to assist help-seeking online?"

1) Opportunities for connectedness

A thread."
REAL,A super important thing to know up front is that when we talk about the ‚ÄúCOVID test‚Äù we are really talking about a set of different tests that have varying ability to detect a current or past infection. I wrote a thread about that here: https://t.co/SQo1NL3Stb
REAL,"While some tests are more sensitive than others, none of them are perfect. We don‚Äôt know how long after becoming infected before a person can spread the virus to others, but we do know that none of the ‚Äúnasal swab‚Äù tests can detect infection immediately."
REAL,"You can think of this similarly to pregnancy tests. When someone becomes pregnant, their body ramps up production of a key hormone called hCG, and that is what a pregnancy test is detecting. However, it takes some time for the level to get to the point that it can be detected."
REAL,"This is why even the most sensitive of tests can‚Äôt tell someone if they‚Äôre pregnant until several days after they become pregnant. Same goes for infections. When someone is first infected, it starts with a small number of virus molecules, and then those replicate over time."
REAL,"Different nasal swab tests will be able to detect and diagnose an infection at varying times post-infection, but all of them take some time. And, just like how you‚Äôre either pregnant or you‚Äôre not, you‚Äôre either infected or you‚Äôre not, independent of what the test says."
REAL,"So, where does this leave us? Are the tests useless? Definitely not! It‚Äôs just critical that we understand their limitations. If you get a positive test result, there‚Äôs a good chance you have the virus and should get treated and isolate yourself."
REAL,"But, if you get a negative result (and especially if you have symptoms) this does not mean you can safely go about normal life without still having some risk of spreading the virus. You might just be too early in the infection to test positive."
REAL,"The blood test is important since we don‚Äôt currently know how many people have been infected and just didn‚Äôt have symptoms. Right now, the data suggest that people who have had COVID-19 cannot get it again, so the blood test might tell how many people are immune."
REAL,"As we talk about reopening, it‚Äôs important to realize that ‚Äúgetting back to normal‚Äù should probably mean ‚Äústarting up with a new normal.‚Äù If we care about the most vulnerable people in our population, we need to realize the risks that no test can fully eliminate."

REAL,"we... literally cannot test for immunity, though.... https://t.co/NotbpW0SwP"
REAL,"You can do COVID-19 diagnostics through other methods (sputum instead of pharyngeal-laryngeal swabs, or CT scans), which have a higher sensitivity, but still only test for active infection."
REAL,"There are two companies currently developing an antigen test, which would test for someone who has had an infection in the past. However, seroconversion for SARS-CoV-2 takes about two weeks, so there's a lag."
REAL,"Furthermore, it's *not* currently known whether it is possible to be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 (ie, to get COVID-19 twice).

We hope not, but this is *not* known."
REAL,"In other words, even if we had a mass-produced SARS-CoV-2 antibody test today, it would not actually test for immunity against COVID-19. Because we don't know if antibodies provide immunity, or even resistance."
REAL,"There are plenty of viruses for which past infections produce detectable antibodies, but for which the antibodies don't provide meaningful levels of protection against reinfection.

Is SARS-CoV-2 one of them? We don't know."
REAL,"Based on some studies of *other* coronaviruses, people are speculating that antibodies provide at least partial protection against reinfection for SARS-CoV-2.

However, that relies on a lot of assumptions, any one of which could be incorrect. Again, as of today, we don't know."
REAL,"PCR testing is important for other reasons, and antigen testing will be important for a different set of reasons. But it is dangerously misleading to imply that we can test for immunity against COVID-19, or that we expect to be able to in the future.

We can't count on it."
REAL,"And the phase ""testing to show who has had the virus and is immune"" is especially dangerous because it implies that people who have had the virus are immune.

This is one of the biggest open questions at the moment about COVID-19! It's not something we can assume or rely on!!"
REAL,"Again: no matter what the intention, it is really harmful to have politicians spreading misconceptions or misinformation about COVID-19 during the middle of a pandemics. People take actions based on the information they hear, and misinformation literally has the power to kill."
REAL,"People who have cleared COVID-19 could still be susceptible to another case. They *could* also still carry the virus and infect someone else.

(We don't know yet that they cannot, so we must assume that they can, because many common viruses do work this way)."
REAL,"If we find out otherwise at some point... that's wonderful! But it'll be a while before we know that. In the absolute *best* case, we're talking on the order of a couple of months, not a couple of days or a couple of weeks."
REAL,"so at best, telling people that social distancing will end because of immunity testing is a false sense of hope - in reality, there's no way people will still be social distancing by the time we have hard data on whether immunity testing is even possible"
REAL,"Literally, for all we know, SARS-CoV-2 could be like influenza, which mutates rapidly enough that immunity against previous years don't protect (much) against the current year.

We won't know if that's true or not with certainty until fall 2020 at earliest."

REAL,"5/19 Trusts have also made as many staff as possible available for testing to support wider testing effort. NHS will today reach end April 25,000 tests/day target it was set. But overall national testing effort has struggled &amp; lots of work still needed to make it fit for purpose."

Americans are sick and dying. What are you waiting for!? https://t.co/WsZCnTDtWe"
REAL,"Cryin‚Äô Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over &amp; over again. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have enough testing ,‚Äù he would repeat, when he knows we have done a great job on Testing, just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied, gave NY SALT. Run AOC!"
REAL,"@realDonaldTrump You can't hide the facts. We DON'T have enough tests.
63,871 Americans are still dead, no matter how much you want to downplay it.

REAL,"@dvillella @realDonaldTrump You know a test wouldn't have saved them, right? There is no cure or vaccine yet. A test would only confirm what they died from."
REAL,"Let‚Äôs now disaggregate this. The 122,000 total includes almost 40,000 tests posted to homes and patients in hospital. There are no figures for how many of the 40,000 we‚Äôre actually tested/processed. Also only 73,000 people were checked as some had multiple tests. https://t.co/4mXt3V9D3O"
REAL,"The original target was 100,000 people tested by end-April. That target has been missed, despite the headline figure. Indeed the more you looked at the 122,000 stat, the more it looks a propaganda figure rather than a reliable guide."

REAL,"@DailyMailUK Not really a shock, more to the point to what are these tests doing to help the process ? ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have covid ‚Äú Brilliant go back home and sit and watch tv go shopping tomorrow to potentially catch it ü§î"
REAL,@Ginjarella @DailyMailUK Again if you‚Äôve got covid but are not in any kind of difficulty what‚Äôs the testing going to achieve? If you feel that unwell you‚Äôll go to hospital ü§î
