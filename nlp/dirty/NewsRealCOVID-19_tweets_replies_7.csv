Absolutely positively not.  If it was in the US then it would have already spread everywhere and by Jan we would have had the huge outbreak."

That is how other countries actually beat it."

There are two main ways we can make the pandemic better.  Get a vaccine or get better treatment. There has been some great movement in getting better treatment and that is why mortality is going down"
REAL,"The first good treatment was remdesivir. This has shown to cut down hospital stays by 4 days on average.  It has not decreased the mortality rate.  It is also super expensive.

REAL,Needless to say Hydroxychloroquin was a huge failure.  There was really only one person who thought it would be usefull.
REAL,"But these drugs and better ventilation techniques and less crowded hospitals are all reasons the mortality rate has been better than the first outbreak.  

If our hospitals get overrun again, expect mortality to go up again."
REAL,"@BoomerBolts has a good question, but not one that is easily answerable and it changes.  

Right now, today, one of 150 people infected dies. But that could change.  

It could change because of treatment as discussed as above. https://t.co/u03l2keelZ"

REAL,"WHO CAN DONATE / CRITERIA :
‚Ä¢You need to have recovered from sars Cov-2.
‚Ä¢You should wait 15 days after the test comes negative.
‚Ä¢Your IgG test is positive (the hospital does that for you). As many patients don‚Äôt develop the killer antibodies at all."
REAL,"‚Ä¢Your antigen titers are nil, because these can aggravate the symptoms.
‚Ä¢Age: 18-55 years old male and nulliparous female.
‚Ä¢Weight above 50kg and hb &gt;12.5(females) and &gt;13 (males)
‚Ä¢ you are not using steriods medications since  last 1 -2 week ."
REAL,"Some people are advised , not to donate plasma:
‚ùåPeople with pre-existing diseases.
‚ùåPeople above 55 yrs of age 

PROCEDURE :
‚Ä¢The whole process takes 1-2 hours.
‚Ä¢Blood is taken from the donor through IV line.
‚Ä¢Processed in a centrifuge machine."
REAL,"‚Ä¢Desired cells are taken from the blood.
‚Ä¢Rest of the blood is returned to the body.

HOW OFTEN CAN PLASMA BE DONATED and how many lives can be saved by it?

 ideally plasma should be donated after 12 weeks of disease."
REAL,"But in our setup we are short of recovered patients so we can take earlier recovered cases.
‚Ä¢Plasma can be donated more often than blood i.e  after every 2 weeks and 2 times / week  in our setup 
‚Ä¢Two infected patients can be saved by one plasma donation!"
REAL,"Approximately 200ml plasma Dose is effective to save one life. 
‚Ä¢ Antibody titres needs to be done ( ELISA system for anti Corona IGg antibodies )"
REAL,"‚Ä¢Donor will have to get some tests done before he donates ( LFTs ,RFTs ,CBC, Serum electrolytes ,albumin , hepatitis screening, sexually transmitted infections screening  etc .)"
REAL,"WAS IT HARMFUL :
No, it is not .
After donating plasma one should drink water in a quite good amount, eat protein and healthy food. 
 Some people think that if he donates plasma he may again get infected by COVID 19 because there will be a shortage of antibodies."
REAL,".  It is a wrong concept. Our immune system automatically fills up the shortage of antibodies as we eat protein because the antibody is nothing just a complex compound of protein.
So we all should come a step front to donate  plasma to save the nation.
Retweet to aware."
REAL,@dcislamabad @DcIsloHamza @iihtishamm @geonews_urdu @KG0__ @ashoswai
REAL,"‚Ä¢ Is it harmful for me to donate plasma?
. Who can donate plasma and who can't ?

  WHAT IS PLASMA  : plasma is a 'yellowish liquid' component of blood. In this plasma, our IMMUNE system releases many antibodies that movers around as a Soldier to keep our body-safe."
REAL,After recovering from COVID-19 Our immune system recognizes the virus and produces a targeted antibody that Neutralises the virus from attacking our body. The antibody binds with the receptors of the virus so they cannot get inside the cell.
REAL,These antibodies are then transferred to the patient and it helps them recover very early.
REAL,"PLASMA THERAPY : 
Plasma infusion also called passive immunization  is a process whereby the sterilize antibodies from a recovered SYMPTOMATIC patient of COVID-19 is transfused in an affected patient."

REAL,"Don't use a synthetic or polyester because they've looked at the virus's ability to survive on surfaces, and spandex is the worst.

Also, it is recommended that you wash and dry the fabric two or three times before cutting it, so it doesn't shrink later."
REAL,"You can make a mask out of a T-shirt too. 

No matter what material you use, try to make it fit closely to your face and don't touch the front once you've started wearing it.

If you use cloth masks, make a number of them so you can wear a fresh one each time you go out."
REAL,"How often do I need to wash my homemade mask?

Think of a mask as like underwear: It needs to be washed after each use.

You don't take this dirty mask off, put it in your purse and then stick it back on your face."
REAL,"Once you put on your mask, is potentially either touching your coughs, sneezes or the spray of your speech or protecting you from the coughs, spray, speech of other people. Hence, it's likely contaminated and needs to basically be either discarded or washed."
REAL,"So if you're wearing a cloth mask, put it into the laundry basket immediately. If it's disposable, throw it away.

It's a big no-no to pull the mask down to eat a snack, then pull it back up: You've just gotten whatever dirty stuff is on the mask on your hands &amp; into your mouth."
REAL,"Would a scarf work?

Probably not as well as a mask that fits closely to your face. Imagine putting on a loosely knit scarf with lots of holes in it. Definitely not be very effective.

The goal is to create a tight barrier that catches droplets and keeps others from coming in."
REAL,"Do masks confer any other benefits?

Masks can also function as an important visual cue. They're a reminder that we need to be taking these precautions and serve as a reminder to people to keep that 6-foot buffer. It should be seen as a badge of honour."
REAL,"If you're wearing a mask in public, it means you're concerned about your neighbours and strangers on the chance that you're infectious. You're making an effort to limit how you might impact others and vice versa.

Masks can also give the wearer a welcome sense of security."
REAL,"So please, keep these guidelines in mind.

Never leave home without your mask ensure you maintain the highest standards of mask hygiene as you go out daily.

This is not the time to be playing Future's 'Mask Off' (Dad joke, we know).

Do have a lovely evening."
REAL,"The best masks are N95 respirators, but the general public is urged not to use them because they are fiercely needed by health care workers right now. Same goes for surgical masks ‚Äî those thin blue models. They offer less protection but are helpful and are also in short supply."
REAL,"If I'm wearing a mask and someone sneezes on me, how would the mask protect me?

When an infected person without a mask sneezes or coughs, the droplets would hit your mask instead of your mouth and nose."
REAL,"However, maximum protection is guaranteed only if you use the mask properly and don't touch it with your hands afterwards.

Here, the next step is to take the mask off by the ear bands and either wash or discard it ‚Äî without touching the front of it."
REAL,"This here is why masks (of whatever type) fails - people don't use them correctly. They touch the front of it. They adjust it. They push it down somehow to get their nose stuck out.

If you touch the front of the mask, that person's cough or sneeze droplets are now on your hands."
REAL,"You should always take off your mask by removing the elastics or straps from behind your ears. Don't touch the front.

One more thing: Ideally you would have eye protection because eyes are a vulnerable route. Glasses and sunglasses aren't perfect but they can help."
REAL,@mikedietsche Nice find.
REAL,@richardursomd It isn't close enough since it can't infect humans while SARS_Cov2 does. And no mention of how it could acquire HIV sequences Nobel Prize winner noted.
REAL,@beachvetlbc I agree. I‚Äôm sure he will be discredited somehow. An accidental escape from the lab makes sense. Manipulating the virus to gain function is being done in labs. HIV fragments on the binding domain that may affect CD4 lymphocytes. It all seem
REAL,"@richardursomd There should be no question SARS-COV-19 was engineered, but motive is unknown.  The #Covid19 pandemic has shown the need to begin treating these labs as if they are developing weapons of mass destruction.   The motives behind this work are "

REAL,"Moreover, the FM is now discussing ‚Äòeradicating‚Äô the virus before relaxing the restrictions, Jacina Aderne style. But NZ never had anything close to the infection rates we had, principally because, to put it mildly, Wellington is a rather less global city than London."
REAL,"The consequences of schools being out are severe in a number of ways. Economic, because parents can‚Äôt work. Poverty, for the same reason. Female participation in the workforce. Mental health. Rarely but devastatingly, child protection."
REAL,"Most widespread and obvious, of course, lost attainment, particularly amongst the poorest. And particularly at pinch points such as exam sitters, where talk of a lost generation is *not* overblown."

REAL,Book 62: The Shadow Lines by Amitav Ghosh. A reread (I think for the 4th time) that I will never tire of. Very highly recommended to those who have yet to read this gem. https://t.co/s75y0IDAHi

REAL,"Book 65: Little Gods by Meng Jin. A very interesting premise that falls flat in some places and shines in others. A book again about finding your roots, breaking away from tradition, and exploring relationships. https://t.co/MZksJ10tlm"
REAL,"Book 66: Darkness by Ratnakar Matkari. Translated from the Marathi by Vikrant Pande. 

‚ÄúDarkness‚Äù for me worked on several plot points, stories, and gave me the much-needed spooks. At the same time, it also got repetitive in most part, and predictable.

https://t.co/T12uOKNifQ"
REAL,"Book 67: Olive, Again by Elizabeth Strout. The sequel in a sense (you don't need to read Olive Kitteridge) and a brilliant one at that. Strout hits it out of the park, once more. https://t.co/W0h3oJ6IZY"
REAL,"Book 68: Train to Pakistan by Khushwant Singh. 

Train to Pakistan to about human nature, religion, the concept of life and death, and how suddenly it is either each man for his own or coming together of people in times of crisis.

REAL,"Book 61 of 2020. The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse by Charlie Mackesy

We all need to pause and consume art that heals. The kind of art that doesn‚Äôt weigh heavy on your heart.

REAL,"Book 69: The Clothesline Swing by Ahmad Danny Ramadan. 

The Clothesline Swing is about forbidden love, about home that is no longer home ‚Äì or will always be in memory, it is about the stories that keep us alive and make us live one day to the next. 

https://t.co/rFpBfP7eQq"
REAL,"Book 70: Hamnet by Maggie O'Farrell. 

Maggie O'Farrell brings to light the death of Shakespeare's son, the grief of a father and a family, and how he came to write Hamlet. True or not, this book had me weep and stunned by its prose. https://t.co/z9aPu4rQEt"
REAL,"Book 71: Exhalation by Ted Chiang. All I can say is that this collection of stories breaks the concept of genre. Each story is just a story and a damn good one at that. Just read this collection, please. https://t.co/aZrBAvybYF"
REAL,"Book 73: Grandmothers by Salley Vickers. 

Grandmothers is all about relationships, intersecting lives, and the back stories of women who are otherwise only seen as most ordinary.

REAL,"Book 74: Guestbook: Ghost Stories by Leanne Shapton. 

From a tennis player who breaks down after every win (you will know why when you read it) to the different versions of how people viewed the iceberg that sank the Titanic, each story is creepy.

REAL,"Book 75: Index Cards by Moyra Davey.

REAL,"Book 76: The Turner House by Angela Flournoy. 

An epic story of a family - spanning generations of loss and love and above all mental illness and addiction that runs right through them. https://t.co/qIv1rsGEFS"
REAL,"Book 77: The Death of Vivek Oji by Akwaeke Emezi. 

The story is about Vivek Oji and his death and life ‚Äì and what led to his death. It is about gender fluidity in a place where LGBT rights are not recognised, and it is a crime to be anything but normal. 

https://t.co/IpMYgbtswt"
REAL,"Book 78: Sleepovers by Jacqueline Wilson. 

Wilson writes about young girls and their sisterhood in the sweetest and real manner. It is a lesson on empathy and kindness which we so need in the world we live in.

REAL,Book 79: Atonement by Ian McEwan. I do not know why I waited this long to read this fantastic piece of work. I won't watch the movie but please read this book. McEwan's writing is perfect. https://t.co/EMZ1jP9djJ
REAL,Book 80: Cockroaches by Scholastique Mukasonga. Translated from the French by Jordan Stump. Not an easy read. This is the story of Scholastique's Tutsi family being wiped away completely in the Rwandan genocide of 1994. It reminded me of the Delhi pogrom of Muslims of 2020. https://t.co/d6VYapi6En

REAL,"Book 83: Writers and Lovers by Lily King. Hands down, this is one of the best books I've read this year. A book about what it takes to be a writer, about friendships, lovers, and what it takes to be alive. Funny and wise. https://t.co/L9e6eZfvSC"
REAL,"Book 84: Optic Nerve by Mar√≠a Gainza. Translated from the Spanish by Thomas Bunstead. The narrator's relationship with art and how it impacts her life is something you don't come across in literature and when you do, you devour it. https://t.co/RyLxIA6EAS"
REAL,"Book 85: If it Bleeds by Stephen King. This collection of novellas may not be his best work or even amongst the best, but he is King and the classic elements are all there. Good writing. Plot twists. Suspense. Thrill. Lots of emotion. https://t.co/0Q6EP22Aow"
REAL,"Book 86: The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern. This one will take some time for you to get into. Fantasy, supernatural, and a journey at the heart of it. It meanders for sure, but I fell in love with the narrative and prose. https://t.co/ClMguOtWo5"
REAL,"Book 87: The Dead Camel and Other Stories of Love by Parvati Sharma. Love of all kinds: sibling, parental, homosexual, heterosexual, three-way, self-obsessed love, and the works. Love that is disfigured. Love that is not. Just stories of love, and more love. Read it. https://t.co/3JUYY4YbBi"
REAL,Book 88: Binti by  Nnedi Okorafor. A coming of age book in space. A girl who chooses to attend the University far and beyond against the wishes of her family. Okorafor‚Äôs use of cultural distinctions is evident and brilliantly done. Can't wait to read the other two parts. https://t.co/So50NlalzT

NIA can make it's own regulations but they MUST be CEDAW compliant
NIO in contact with NIDoH which is responsible for commissioning abortion services, will fund GB access in interim"

REAL,Mtaalamu atahitaji kuchukua sampuli sahihi kulingana na kipimo anachotaka kutumia kisha kuichakata maabara na kutoa majibu. Vipimo vya virusi vya corona vimegawanywa katika makundi makuu mawili.
REAL,"Kama nilivyosema, upimaji wa virusi vya corona maabara umegawanywa katika makundi wakuu mawili:

¬∑ Kuangalia kama mtu amewahi kupata maambukizi ya corona (maambukizi ya zamani).
¬∑ Kupima maambukizi ya sasa."
REAL,"1. Kuangalia maambukizi ya zamani: Kama inavyotokea kwa wadudu wengine, kirusi cha corona kinapoingia mwilini, mwili hutengeneza askari ili kupambana na mgeni huyu ambaye mwili haumtambui kwa muda ule. Askari hawa kwa kiingereza wanaitwa antibodies. https://t.co/HEukthn6PA"
REAL,"Askari wa mwili huwa na sifa ya kuwa maalumu (specific) kwa mdudu husika, hii inatokana na kuwa mwili hutengeneza askari wake kutokana na mdudu aliyeingia kipindi hicho, na ndiyo maana mtu mmoja anaweza kuwa... https://t.co/udc6IZ9zRd"
REAL,"...kuwa na askari wa kukabiliana na malaria huku upande mwingine ana askari wa kukabiliana za virusi vya UKIMWI, ni mifumo ambayo haiingiliani. Ufanyaji kazi wa kipimo hiki ni kama vipimo vingine vya haraka (serological rapid tests) vinavyofanyika."
REAL,"Huangalia na kukamata hawa askari ambao walitengenezwa mwilini baada ya kirusi kuingia. Kama nilivyosema mwanzo, mwili hutengeneza askari pale tu unapogundua kirusi kimeingia mwilini, hii ina maana kuwa mwili usingetengeneza askari hawa ikiwa hiki kirusi kisingeingia mwilini."
REAL,Kipimo hiki kimetengenezewa uwezo wa kuzitambua askari hao na kuonesha alama ya mstari (chanya) kuashiria askari wapo. Kinaitwa kipimo cha kuangalia maambukizi yaliyopita sababu askari siyo mdudu bali ni kinga ya mwili inayotokana na kuingiliwa na mdudu.
REAL,"Mwili ulivyo, hata kama mdudu huyu ataondoka basi kinga zitaendelea kuonekana kwa siku kadhaa ili kuhakikisha hakuna mdudu kabisa hivyo ukipima ndani ya siku ambazo kinga bado zipo kwenye mzunguko kwa kutumia kipimo hiki bado utaonekana una ugonjwa."
REAL,Mwili wa binadamu unapopata maambukizi ya virusi vya corona huchukua wiki moja mpaka tatu ili kutengeneza askari wake (IgM na IgG) mwilini.
REAL,Hii ina maana unaweza kuwa na ugonjwa ila kabla ya hizi siku za utengenezaji wa kinga kukamilika ukipimwa kwa kipimo hiki utaonesha hauna ugonjwa. Ndiyo sababu kinaitwa kipimo cha kuangalia maambukizi ya zamani.
REAL,"Inabidi mtu awe ameugua kwa muda, atengeneze kinga ndiyo uweze kupima kuangalia uwepo wa virusi vya corona. Hata kama mtu ameugua na kupona kwa siku kadhaa (mpaka siku 28) bado kinga hizi zitaendelea kuonekana katika mzunguko."
REAL,Kipimo hiki kinatumiwa katika upimaji wa watu wengi (mass screening) na sampuli ya damu ndio hutumika. Damu inachukuliwa kisha inawekwa kwenye kipimo cha haraka (rapid test) kama inavyofanyika kwa ukimwi na malaria. Baada ya muda majibu yanatoka.
REAL,2.Kuangalia maambukizi ya sasa: Hii ni kundi la pili la upimaji wa virusi vya corona na hapa tunatumia mashine aina ya RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription ‚Äì Polymerase Chain Reaction). https://t.co/q5SlHuhzEH
REAL,Mashine hii ina uwezo wa kuangalia maambukizi ya sasa kwa sababu inapima uwepo wa virusi katika mwili wa binadamu. PCR imebaki kuwa kipimo cha kuaminika kitaalamu inaitwa confirmatory test ikiwa na maana...
REAL,"licha ya mgonjwa kupima kipimo cha kwanza cha haraka (rapid test) hiki ndio kipimo kitakacho tuhakikishia kuwa ni kweli huyu mgonjwa anaumwa au haumwi. 

Hiyo mashine kule nyuma ndio PCR. Ni mashine kubwa hata kwa nafasi."
REAL,"Sifa ya kirusi ni kuwa na RNA na sio DNA, hivyo hatua ya kwanza ya PCR ni kubadilisha RNA iliyo ndani ya kirusi kuwa DNA katika utaratibu unaoitwa RT au Reverse Transcription,"
REAL,"Baada ya kubadilisha RNA kuwa DNA mashine hii hukuza na kuzalisha nakala nyingi za hii DNA ili kumuwezesha mtaalamu kusoma kirusi hiki na kukitambua. Kama ulivyosoma, hakuna namna mashine hii inaweza kukosa kirusi ikiwa kweli kipo katika mwili wa binadamu."
REAL,"Ni mashine inayohusisha vinasaba (DNA). Sampuli kama mate, majimaji katika njia ya pua na koo (nasal and throat swab) au makohozi hutumika katika upimaji wa virusi vya corona aina ya SARS-CoV-2. https://t.co/4mZyNkdv09"
REAL,Tutasema mgonjwa ana ugonjwa wa corona endapo vipimo vyote viwili vitatumika (Atapiwa kipimo cha awali (Antibody test) na kuhakikiwa na kipimo cha pili - PCR). Matumizi ya sampuli sahihi ni muhimu katika ugunduzi wa ugonjwa huu.
REAL,"Kuna sababu kadhaa ambazo husababisha kupata majibu ambayo sio sahihi huku sababu kubwa ni sampuli kutokuwa sahihi au kutokuwa na ubora, kuwahi au kuchelewa kukusanya sampuli, usafirishaji mbovu au endapo mtu akiwa ametumia dawa kabla ya kupima."

REAL,One of the reasons that Black and Hispanic people nationwide are known to be having a much harder time accessing testing unless they end up in an emergency room in acute distress is because predominantly white neighborhoods are being given testing priority in much of the US.
REAL,"And well, somebody showing up in my mentions and Karen'ing about Lincoln Park being where they decided to put the walk-up testing site is a good example of why communities nationwide keep having disparate access to testing."

REAL,"July is generally a terrible time to announce college closures since students are typically stuck with few other options. Some colleges may stay online through spring 2021 to finish students out, which is a responsible course of action. (20/)"
REAL,"And other colleges may close right away. But at least in this situation, students can choose from a bunch of online options from colleges that are looking for additional tuition revenue. So it could be worse, I guess? (21/)"
REAL,"Having to make the hard decisions will be the theme for July. Colleges need time to get physical campuses ready for whoever is allowed to be there, and that isn't cheap. And colleges need time to get a good online model together that's better than spring. (8/)"

REAL,"7) But as in every human institution, there‚Äôs major path dependency in our language, and therefore our politics and our mental model of the world. ‚ÄúAdaptation‚Äù and ‚Äúmitigation‚Äù have 20+ years of history behind them, plus major institutions &amp; stakeholders bought into this frame."

REAL,"13) So, a modest proposal for a few key actors:

UK Government (#COP26 host) &amp; UNFCCC Secretariat: please use the Covid pause in 2020 to move real economy #ClimateAction onto the main diplomatic stage, and relegate treaty negotiations to the background, where they should be."
REAL,"14) Biden Transition Team: please make good on your campaign pledge to ""convene a climate world summit"" by May 1, 2021. Use it to reset the diplomatic clock on #climateaction. Let's rebuild US leadership with the kind of action-forcing agenda that meets the scale of the challenge"

REAL,"3) When I attended COP6 in 2000, the entire apparatus of the UNFCCC and the overwhelming majority of the energy, resources, bandwidth and white papers was focused on cutting emissions ‚Äî mitigation. Adaptation was thought of, if at all, as a distant problem, both in time &amp; space."
REAL,"4) The problem back then was one part intellectual ‚Äî what to call these new concepts/categories ‚Äî and one part political ‚Äî who‚Äôs on the hook for what, legally &amp; financially speaking?

REAL,Nigeria has seen a significant step increase in testing capacity recently. This is a huge departure from the 256 tests conducted in the first 30 days.  PCR Labs have increased from 4 to 38 in about 110 days. Great effort by .@NCDCgov &amp; #PTFCOVID19. More work to be done https://t.co/f1u52Q1Kls
REAL,"On April 30, Nigeria conducted 2070 tests with 18 PCR Laboratories.  The record daily test so far is 3058 tests on 11 June. The average daily test (17-24 June) is 2295 tests."
REAL,"Comparing the number of tests conducted on April 30 with 18 labs (2070 tests) with the daily test average of 2295 tests (38 Labs), It seems the 210% increase in PCR labs between April and Jun has not translated into maximum output."
REAL,"As Nigeria plans to take the next step in the covid19 war, the key tactics will be rapid and widespread testing. This will be key to any Govt decision making.   - OA"
REAL,"Of note is that Nigeria recorded the highest daily % positive on June 22,  37.3% positive.  This indicates 2 things. a) Increased rate of transmission.  b) Under testing"
REAL,"Summary 
The review of Covid19 key performance metrics from Nigeria clearly indicate that the battle against Covid19 is far from over.  All the metrics point to a disturbing trend and indicate tougher days and tough decisions ahead for Nigeria"
REAL,"Conclusion 
Nigeria needs a purpose driven strategy. Detect- Isolate- Treat is strongly dependent on the first item ‚ÄúTESTING‚Äù.  Nigeria can do a lot better with the current test capacity."
REAL,"To move forward and address this pandemic headon, Nigeria needs a consistent daily test capacity of 15,000-20,000 tests before it is too late. 
Lockdown without the capacity to test 15-20K daily will come at a high economic cost to the nation with limited benefits."
REAL,"It is my opinion that Nigeria can do much better regarding testing. Our current daily test average of 2200 tests per day is grossly below target.

REAL,"One point being made today and that was made at an elections board hearing earlier this week: the June 2 snafus likely had a disproportionate impact on senior voters, who may not have gotten absentee ballots and would have been understandably afraid to vote in person."
REAL,"There were concerns raised this week that curbside voting at vote centers was understaffed, leading to long waits for many disabled and senior voters waiting to cast ballots. At Turkey Thicket in Ward 5, I saw lines of cars stretching more than a block down from the vote center."
REAL,"Derek Ford, chair of the Ward 7 Democrats, wants all 144 voting precincts opened in November. The Board of Elections says it will have 40 vote centers, double what they used in the primary. The decision to not open all precincts came from difficulty staffing them all."
REAL,"""It takes you about three elections in order to get your practices and procedures correct and understand how voters respond to them,"" says Doug Lewis, director of the Election Center, talking about the transition to vote-by-mail."
REAL,"""We acknowledge there were difficulties,"" says D.C. Board of Elections chair Michael Bennett, starting his testimony on the June 2 primary. He says time was the biggest challenge in shifting to a predominantly by-mail election."
REAL,"As for vote centers, he says the pandemic meant the elections board lost some 1,700 poll workers and other volunteers who would otherwise man 144 polling places. Instead, they used some 500 staff and workers to prepare and run the primary."
REAL,"""[The D.C. Board of Elections] is severely under-resourced,"" says Bennett, warning that November's election won't run more smoothly if the city doesn't pony up more money."
REAL,"""I'm having a hard time with that one,"" says Allen in response to the claim that the elections board is underfunded. He says he asked officials this year if they needed more money, and they never said yes."
REAL,"""Some of the known unknowns... was whether our systems could scale,"" responds Bennett. ""As we started to try and scale... it was very clear that we were under-resourced."" He says it's not just money, but also people."
REAL,"""You work long, you work wrong,"" says elections board director Alice Miller of the experience preparing for the primary during a pandemic. ""We shouldn't be doing work like that."""
REAL,"""I know that you and the staff... were sleeping at the centers. You were working hard. I will take issue that you were underfunded when you have existing balances of funds you haven't used,"" says Allen."
REAL,"""It seems like there wasn't even a public announcement about it,"" says Allen about the sudden decision to send ballots to all 45,000 voters in Ward 2 ahead of the special election."
REAL,"""I didn't want to announce it because I wasn't sure we could do it,"" says Alice Miller, about the decision. She says the call was influenced by the issues the board saw ahead of the June 2 primary, and the fact that the Ward 2 ballot was simpler and went to fewer people."
REAL,"""Making all those changes... can be even more disastrous than sticking with what you have,"" says Bennett, responding to a question on why the elections board did not quickly switch out tech platforms when issues came up with absentee ballots, the app, and more."
REAL,"""There is very clear evidence that the board was aware of systemic issues with technology and capacity... and there was no effort to make adjustments,"" says @tweetelissa."
REAL,"""We had a lot of requests that came in through our email system that were lost,"" says Alice Miller about why some voters did not get absentee ballots they requested."
REAL,"""I'm not as familiar with the technology as I should be,"" says Alice Miller, head of the D.C. Board of Elections, about the app voters could use to request an absentee ballot. Ouch."
REAL,"NEWS: Alice Miller, the director of the D.C. Board of Elections says that 1,100 people who requested absentee ballots did not get them ahead of the June 2 primary. Of that number, 700 ultimately cast in-person ballots. But that means at least 400 fully disenfranchised."
REAL,"Now, context is necessary: more than 114,000 votes were cast in the June 2 primary, roughly 70% by mail."
REAL,"Miller says that seven staff at the D.C. Board of Elections were responsible for mailing out the 45,000 ballots to Ward 2 voters for the June 16 special election. That's more than 6,400 ballots per staff member. That's bonkers."
REAL,"""Fix the app! Make sure we have one that works,"" says @AnitaBondsDC to D.C. Board of Elections officials. ""Little things like that go a long way."""
REAL,"""We do need to focus on curbside [voting],"" says Michael Bennett, chair of the Board of Elections. Some vote centers had no staff member to deal with curbside voters. That impacted seniors, and voters with disabilities."
REAL,"""The robocall never went out,"" says Bennett about what he had initially promised as a big tool to inform voters about the changes to how the June 2 primary would work. The board was looking for a celebrity for the call (really), but never found one."
REAL,"""It kinda got lost in the sauce with a bunch of other stuff. It should have been done,"" says Bennett about the robocall. (Remember that D.C. did multiple robocalls around COVID-19.)"
REAL,"""I don't hear anyone saying why it didn't get done,"" says Allen, pressing on why the robocall never happened. ""I don't have an answer for you,"" says Bennett."
REAL,"""I never heard a radio ad, I didn't see an ad in the paper,"" says Allen, calling into question Bennett's claim that there were ads on local radio, TV and in newspapers. Election officials insist they did happen."
REAL,"OK, the Council hearing on the June 2 primary is over. Alice Miller made an interesting point at the end. She basically said she thinks the era of voting at local churches and gyms is over, and that D.C. may need ""super vote centers"" at places like the Convention Center."
REAL,"She also basically said that no matter how many ballots are mailed to people ahead of November's election, people will still come out and vote in person."

REAL,"Their giving themselves to the Lord is proof that their giving materially is borne out of love.

The first giving of the Macedonian Church was to reveal their motive. When the giving is solely for the good of others, then it is of God."
REAL,"When it comes to Christian giving, it has to do with releasing of resources, i.e. generous giving solely for the good of others.

It is difficult to be reckoned with as a good Christian giver when the giver himself is not given to service."
REAL,"In 2Corinthians 8:7 Paul is saying ‚Äúas you abound in the practice of the things of the spirit and commitment to the service of Jesus, seek that you also abound in the grace of giving‚Äù

Committing of material resources the Christian way towards others is part of Christian service"
REAL,"You cannot say that you have the motive and it doesn‚Äôt end in communicating material things.

The motive is like giving in the heart and we must see it manifest."
REAL,"It is not encouraged in the faith that you commit material resources with a wrong motive.

Rather, it must be a product of your heart.

Giving begins in the heart, i.e. service ‚Äì to be willing to give yourself to the service of the Lord."
REAL,"That willingness will make it visible in committing your material resources towards others.

Christ gave to us and we then became the beneficiaries of the giving.

Hence, your giving will be patterned that way. We will give materially for others and not for our benefit."
REAL,"Rather, it‚Äôs a human endeavor. Christian giving is however concerned with the motive. 

The ""Christianity"" in the giving is the motive. The issue is not to redefine the act of giving but however the motive."
REAL,"In 2Corinthians 8, Paul writes to the churches at Corinth and tells them of the grace of God given to the Macedonian church.

It‚Äôs vital to note that the grace of God here is not referring to the benevolence that we have in Christ that forgave our sins, i.e. salvation."
REAL,"The grace of God bestowed upon the churches of Macedonia was that they were able to abound in giving/generosity though they were in a great trial of affliction. Even in the midst of great poverty, they gave generously."
REAL,"In verse 5 of 1Corinthians 8, we see that the Macedonian church gave themselves to the Lord before they gave materially.

REAL,"The lack of planning and preparedness is the outstanding failure of the response to the crisis in the United States. That's the implicit judgment of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine."
REAL,"The academies stated in an assessment of crisis standards of care in March that the primary principle was that ""health care planning must do everything possible never to need CSC."""
REAL,"The academies also specified that in the current pandemic, ""public trust is essential."" That means that leaders would have to be ""proactive, honest, transparent and accountable"" when discussing the condition of their healthcare systems and institutions."
REAL,Has that happened? The answer obviously is no. President Trump and Republican governors such as Arizona's Doug Ducey and Florida's Ron DeSantis have suppressed statistics showing the true rate of infection in their states.
REAL,"Trump's approach to the crisis has been focused in large part in trying to minimize its impact, even denying its existence."
REAL,"States other than Arizona have similar rulebooks to be dusted off in a major emergency. Arizona, however, is the only state that has activated its crisis standard of care procedures ‚Äî so far."
REAL,"""A lot of states actually have activated their crisis standards of care plans,"" Cara Christ, director of Arizona's Department of Health Services, said during a press conference Monday with Ducey. This is a lie."
REAL,"Though most states have prepared a crisis plan, no others have activated it.

Several, however, may be on the verge of doing so, at least regionally, since the surge in cases is placing immense stresses on local capacities."
REAL,"In California, for example, Riverside County's ICU beds were reported to be 99% occupied over the weekend and Los Angeles County is projecting the possibility of running out of hospital beds in two to three weeks and exhausting its intensive care unit beds sometime in July."
REAL,"In Imperial County, an agricultural county on the Mexican border where 23% of tests are coming back positive for COVID-19, 500 patients were transferred to adjoining counties to relieve the local pressure, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday."
REAL,"California is one of several states ranking as leading hot spots of coronavirus infection, though its statewide test positivity average of 5.9% over the last seven days remains lower than other surging states such as Arizona (24.4%), Florida (15.6%) and Texas (14.1%)."
REAL,"All those states are guilty of having reopened commercial and retail establishments, as well as public facilities such as beaches, too soon ‚Äî notably before it was clear that they had adequately clamped down on the community spread of the coronavirus."
REAL,Newsom has urged Californians to continue social distancing &amp; mask-wearing throughout the crisis; his error was to give local officials too much latitude to decide for themselves when they could reopen their economies. Now he is signaling such deference may be coming to an end.
REAL,"Newsom pressured Imperial County into rolling back its reopening, in part by threatening that ""the state of California will assert itself and make sure that happens‚Äù if officials fail to do so."
REAL,"In other states, governors have been more permissive and even interfered with local officials' judgments. Until June 17, Ducey forbade cities and counties to impose stricter rules than the state."
REAL,"In practical terms, that prevented them from keeping bars, restaurants and retail establishments closed or requiring residents to wear masks in public.

Ducey relented under pressure from mayors of Phoenix, Tucson &amp; Flagstaff &amp; in t/face of an undeniable surge in COVID-19 cases."
REAL,"Arizona waited until March 30 to issue a stay-at-home policy, long after other states. Ducey lifted the policy early, on May 15.

Ducey joined Trump at an indoor political rally in Phoenix on June 23 at which an estimated 3,000 persons were in attendance,"
REAL,"crammed shoulder to shoulder and mostly maskless ‚Äî even though a week earlier the city had ordered masks to be worn. Ducey wore a mask bearing the Arizona state seal, but Trump was maskless.

Not until Monday did Ducey reimpose anti-virus measures, prohibiting large gatherings,"
REAL,"ceasing the issuance of new special event licenses, and closing bars, gyms, movie theaters, waterparks and tubing rentals. His order will remain in effect through the month. He didn't order masks to be worn in public."
REAL,"By then, the state already had activated its crisis standards of care, or rationing plan. Let's take a look.

Like other states' plans, Arizona's relies chiefly on a metric known as a SOFA Score, for ""sequential organ failure assessment."""
REAL,"The score is based on the condition of six major organ systems: lungs, circulatory, heart, kidney, liver and neurological.

Arizona assigns points to patients according to their SOFA score range, to a maximum of four points for the most severely affected."
REAL,"Then it adds up to four more points for a subjective assessment of a patient's survivability: two points for those whose death is expected within five years despite successful treatment of COVID-19,"
REAL,and four for those whose death is expected within one year despite successful treatment. Priority for treatment is given to those with lower scores.
REAL,"The guidelines state that judgments are to be made regardless of ""race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, veteran status, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, quality of life, or any other ethically irrelevant criteria."""
REAL,"But several of these factors obviously will play into the point system. Black patients on average tend to suffer from more medical conditions than others, in part because their incomes are lower on average and their access to medical care more limited."
REAL,"Older residents also suffer from more health challenges. And how do medical personnel assess a patient's ""quality of life""?"
REAL,@MarwaAbduljawad @UserExperienceU Yes life can move online amid Coronavirus pandemic  but without human touch and vitality - human robots
REAL,"@MuhammadMobinK1 @UserExperienceU I agree to an extent, but still disagree. Today's educational platforms have been able to integrate human connection virtually, of course this won't replace actual human interaction."

REAL,@swrobbiegsingh Hi! Not too late. I got an early start by asking. :) This is very helpful. Really great to see what you've created and I know another academic who has run for public office (and won)! This is a GREAT idea.
REAL,"(8/) *warned! If you are a person who doesn‚Äôt have many financial resources, try to be a Barbri or Themis rep. You table for them and help them sell bar courses, and they give you a free bar course (otherwise it costs thousands)"
REAL,"(9/) The bar is another way that this career excludes Black people (historically), and anyone who is poor. Please reach out if you are struggling to pay for the LSAT or Bar prep. I would love to brainstorm solutions. We are going to FIX that in due time."
REAL,"(10/) Most people take out graduate loans from the federal government for law school. I am no expert, but I recommend attending a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù school near where you want to work. As someone currently doing that, the ‚Äúlittle‚Äù debt I have seems worth it."
REAL,"(11/) Once you find clubs or orgs that interest you, latch on to an upperclassman (or 4) to mentor you. Having someone to answer your panicked questions that has similar goals has also saved me this year! (S/o @hsimimlama @neeenerweener @PenMeiAlyv and MORE)"
REAL,"(12/) Thinking about finals as your only grade your first semester sounds scarier than it is (I SWEAR!) The key is to wait until you understand what matters in each case, and beginning to outline as soon as you can."
REAL,"(13/) Law school exams are entirely fact pattern driven. That is, you are not tested on the cases you just read the whole semester. You are given sets of facts and your job is to pick out as many legal issues as you can, and discuss in essays"
REAL,"(14/) how each side would argue, and what the court would likely rule (if you can predict that). Logically, I think the way we teach law students can be streamlined to be more functional, but this is the tradition."
REAL,"(15/) Everyone‚Äôs greatest fear is cold calling. To be honest, if you read the reading due that day, you will usually be fine (though some professors are more lethal). And more honesty; sometimes cold calls were the only reason I stayed awake. üò¨"
REAL,"(16/) Outlining is really tough sometimes. I may have struggled with that the most. But if your school has an outline bank (ask older students), you will probably be able to find your professor and what their typical questions look like. Summarize RULES of cases!"
REAL,"(17/) But do your own outlines, buy Quimbee if you have the resources (helps brief cases for you), and work your ass off with your new friends. It‚Äôs a tough year but you will come out having grown and learned about yourself and the law."

REAL,"Most council members tout the improvements as a way to keep well-paying jobs in the community, but Councilman Schilling says he worries that this isn't the best way to allocate the city's resources in the middle of a pandemic."
REAL,"That passes 8-1 with Councilman Schilling being the only dissenting vote. 

Now, we have an agenda item to pay for traffic signals. They apparently had just one bid, but city staff says it's a pretty competitive bidding market rn so there have been fewer bidders."
REAL,"That passes unanimously. 

On to an ordinance that would require folks to bring in their trash cans after 24 hours. There was a bit of discussion last meeting about this, and city staff represented it as more of a housekeeping matter than an opportunity for aggressive enforcement"
REAL,"One local trash provider says there are many people who leave their trash out for long hours, opening it up to having stuff blowing around the neighborhood, animals hanging out in trash cans, etc."
REAL,"Councilman Ollis says he wonders abt the timing of this, where there's a potential for $1,000 fine or jail time for a misdemeanor. 

He says he'll support it though he's not sure putting another regulation on the books is the right thing to do in the current moment."
REAL,"Councilwoman Ferguson says she doesn't want to see the ordinance ""weaponized"" to punish people, but she'll vote for it.

Hosmer notes the city already has the same penalty for leaving  a bag of trash instead of one in a can."
REAL,"City Manager Gage says a citation wouldn't likely be given except in rare circumstances. The first step would likely be a phone call asking people to bring the can in. It'd have to be a ""blatant"" disregard for the rules, likely combined w/ other violations, for a real citation."
REAL,"That passes unanimously. 

Now we're on to public comments! The first is a resolution that would allow the workforce dept to apply for a $2M grant for young adults and veterans to get hands-on training for fish and wildlife conservation."
REAL,"That passes unanimously. 

Now on public comment, council is considering a grant for workforce development that would give $100,000 to train dislocated workers from COVID."
REAL,"Now SPD is asking council to approve an around $500,000 grant from DOJ for COVID-19 expenses, including PPE, COVID training for police officers, testing for police and fire and a bunch of other expenses."
REAL,"That passes unanimously. Now council is hearing an item to make improvements to the landfill with new scales, new entrance signs, storm shelters and a bunch of other stuff. That'll come out to around $6M."
REAL,"So now council is considering something that would regulate the type and quantity of landscaping materials in front of houses, which apparently catch fire fairly often and spread to buildings. The more ya know. 

No public comments on that."
REAL,"Now we're on to petitions and remonstrances. Again to speak is Tim Havens, who last meeting called for more oversight and involvement with policing by council. 

Havens said he showed this video to four experts, all of whom said it was improper. https://t.co/mNdOL7FUfB"
REAL,"He says even if there are body cameras for police, he doesn't think the public will get them. Disciplinary records are  currently not public.

REAL,the type of top surgery i had didn't involve grafting. grafting isn't covered by the government &amp; is a $1500 cost (at the time) in my province so I got the option that was intended for someone who is smaller in the chest than me. they also left tissue.

REAL,Even these protests have not been linked to an outbreak.  So it is likely that being outdoors is pretty safe. https://t.co/PubFU5jqdm
REAL,From @ortega_lesli https://t.co/BGzLagFAAd
REAL,You cannot have a economy that works until people as long as there is a pandemic.  Places that opened up didn't have businesses that earned money because most people were smart enough to not go out because it wasn't safe.
REAL,"In Europe they were able to reopen their businesses because they had strict rules in place, got the virus to low enough levels, and had enough testing to track outbreaks.  We have none of that, and we might not for months because we failed the first time.
https://t.co/PoOImn0JTx"
REAL,"We need to have a nationwide mask rules and have fines for people who don't follow it.  If you are going to be withing 6 feet of someone else, you have to have a mask on.  If you enter a business without a mask, $1,000 fine.  

That is how other countries actually beat it."
REAL,"Also, all indoor bars, clubs, gyms, and restaurants should close.  Those have all been associated with huge outbreaks and the businesses cannot be trusted to operate in the rules.  That is why we are having a huge spike now.

REAL,I have to go get my crying baby so I‚Äôll come back to this in an hour or two. This is a great question from @kmay760 https://t.co/lZXkQStuLw
REAL,"So back to @kmay760‚Äôs question. How is the search for good treatments going???

There are two main ways we can make the pandemic better.  Get a vaccine or get better treatment. There has been some great movement in getting better treatment and that is why mortality is going down"
REAL,"The first good treatment was remdesivir. This has shown to cut down hospital stays by 4 days on average.  It has not decreased the mortality rate.  It is also super expensive. 

https://t.co/P36PsmnmVD"
REAL,"And the next HUGE one is dexamethasone.  This is a very cheap drug that we know a ton about.  

https://t.co/vHwiAe2P2a"
REAL,Needless to say Hydroxychloroquin was a huge failure.  There was really only one person who thought it would be usefull.
REAL,"But these drugs and better ventilation techniques and less crowded hospitals are all reasons the mortality rate has been better than the first outbreak.  

If our hospitals get overrun again, expect mortality to go up again."
REAL,"@BoomerBolts has a good question, but not one that is easily answerable and it changes.  

Right now, today, one of 150 people infected dies. But that could change.  

It could change because of treatment as discussed as above. https://t.co/u03l2keelZ"
