Macrovascular pathology was also seen. 15 (8.6%) patients had acute ischemic infarcts, 11 (6.3%) with non-traumatic hemorrhage, 1 hemorrhagic infarct, and 6 patients with thin circumferential vessel wall enhancement https://t.co/YKR5HXbmtQ"

In summary, neuroimaging of COVID-19 patients show vascular and inflammatory changes. Microvascular and white matter pathology are common. Radiologists should also be vigilant for cranial nerve and spinal nerve root involvement."
