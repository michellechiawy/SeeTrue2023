There are two main ways we can make the pandemic better.  Get a vaccine or get better treatment. There has been some great movement in getting better treatment and that is why mortality is going down"

Right now, today, one of 150 people infected dies. But that could change.

When an infected person without a mask sneezes or coughs, the droplets would hit your mask instead of your mouth and nose."
2512,1930,1257729773486342154,1257729766976782336,"However, maximum protection is guaranteed only if you use the mask properly and don't touch it with your hands afterwards.

Here, the next step is to take the mask off by the ear bands and either wash or discard it ‚Äî without touching the front of it."
2513,1930,1257729773486342154,1257729769006862338,"This here is why masks (of whatever type) fails - people don't use them correctly. They touch the front of it. They adjust it. They push it down somehow to get their nose stuck out.

If you touch the front of the mask, that person's cough or sneeze droplets are now on your hands."
2514,1930,1257729773486342154,1257729771297005576,"You should always take off your mask by removing the elastics or straps from behind your ears. Don't touch the front.

One more thing: Ideally you would have eye protection because eyes are a vulnerable route. Glasses and sunglasses aren't perfect but they can help."

9823,2369,1275173160908972035,1275173163052253184,"4) The problem back then was one part intellectual ‚Äî what to call these new concepts/categories ‚Äî and one part political ‚Äî who‚Äôs on the hook for what, legally &amp; financially speaking?
